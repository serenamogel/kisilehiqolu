He later explained to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">People</a> that they were not living under the same roof.&nbsp;</p><p>Rather, they were neighbors and were limiting themselves to just two homes in the COVID-19 pandemic. In September 2021, Taketa took to Instagram <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">to explain</a>&nbsp;that she and her partner were adopting. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>They welcomed Ana&nbsp;and her son, Sundance-Isamu, aka Sunny, into their blended family.
