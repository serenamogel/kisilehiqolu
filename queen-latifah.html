Latifah has also garnered acclaim for acting, earning her first Oscar nomination for her performance in the 2002 blockbuster musical Chicago, and an Emmy nod for her portrayal of blues singer <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/bessie-smith data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Bessie Smith" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Bessie Smith</a> in the 2015 film Bessie.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Queen Latifah was born Dana Elaine Owens on March 18, 1970, in Newark, New Jersey. The second child of Lance and Rita Owens, Latifah is best known for her social politics, acting skills and gift for rhyme. When she was 8 years old, a Muslim cousin gave her the nickname Latifah, meaning "delicate and sensitive" in Arabic.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Latifah began singing in the choir of Shiloh Baptist Church in Bloomfield, New Jersey, and had her first public performance when she sang a version of "Home" as one of the two Dorothys in a production of The Wizard of Oz at St. Anne's parochial school.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In her first year of high school, Latifah began informal singing and rapping in the restrooms and locker rooms. In her junior year, she formed a rap group, Ladies Fresh, with her friends Tangy B and Landy D in response to the formation of another young women's group. Soon the group was making appearances wherever they could.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Latifah's mother was a catalyst; she was in touch with the students and the music. She invited Mark James, a local disc jockey known as D.J. Mark the 45 King, to appear at a school dance. The basement of James's parents' house in East Orange, equipped with electronic and recording equipment, became the hangout of Latifah and her friends, who called themselves the "Flavor Unit."</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Albums and Songs</h2><h2 data-node-id=10 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Wrath of My Madness,' 'All Hail to the Queen'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">James, who was beginning a career as a producer, gave a demo record of Queen Latifah's rap Princess of the Posse to the host of Yo! MTV Raps, Fred Braithwaite (professionally known as "Fab 5 Freddy"). The recording captured the attention of Tommy Boy Music employee Dante Ross, and in 1988 the label issued her first single, "Wrath of My Madness." The track met with a positive response, affording Latifah the opportunity to launch a European tour and to perform at Harlem's famed Apollo Theater. The next year, Latifah released her first album, All Hail to the Queen, which went on to sell more than 1 million copies.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Nature of a Sista'' and Management</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The artist followed in 1991 with Nature of a Sista', featuring the singles "Fly Girl," "How Do I Love Thee" and "Latifah's Had It Up 2 Here." Meanwhile, she displayed an interest in investment, putting money into a delicatessen and a video store. Realizing that there was an opening for her in record production, Latifah organized and became chief executive officer of the Flavor Unit Records and Management Company, headquartered in Jersey City, New Jersey. By late 1993, the company had signed 17 rap groups, including the very successful Naughty by Nature.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Black Reign,' Grammy for 'U.N.I.T.Y.,' 'Order in the Court'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1993, Latifah recorded a jazz- and reggae-influenced album titled Black Reign. It sold more than 500,000 copies, while the catchy single "U.N.I.T.Y." earned Latifah her first Grammy Award in 1995. She followed in 1998 with her fourth studio effort, Order in the Court, which was notable for being her first album to sport a Parental Advisory warning for explicit lyrics.</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'The Dana Owens Album,' 'Trav'lin' Light,' 'Persona'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Latifah branched out from hip hop to show her range as a singer with The Dana Owens Album (2004), which climbed to No. 16 on the Billboard 200 and earned a Grammy nomination for best jazz vocal album. Trav'lin Light (2007) fared even better on the pop charts and earned a Grammy for instrumental arrangement. Latifah then returned to her rap roots with Persona (2009), though the album drew a mixed response from critics.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Film, TV & Stage</h2><h2 data-node-id=19 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Jungle Fever,' 'Juice,' 'Living Single'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Turning to acting, Latifah made her big-screen debut in <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/spike-lee data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Spike Lee" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Spike Lee</a>'s interracial romance drama Jungle Fever (1991).
