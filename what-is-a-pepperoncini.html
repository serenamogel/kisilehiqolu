In terms of delivery <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">pizza</a>, it’s probably on the lower end of the quality spectrum. But the fact that each pie came with a pepperoncini had us fighting over who’d get to eat it in the end. So, why were we so ravenous about this tiny yellow pepper?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-is-a-pepperoncini><strong>What is a pepperoncini?</strong></h2><p>Pepperoncini, known as friggitelli in Italy, are small, yellow peppers with Mediterranean origins. The pepper is popular in both Italian and Greek cuisines, becoming so synonymous with those countries that they are often called Tuscan peppers, sweet Italian peppers, or golden Greek peppers in the United States and other export countries.</p><p>In America, they are commonly found pickled whole in jars, accompanying Italian or Greek salads, antipasto plates, or as a side to the aforementioned pizzas. The flavor of pepperoncini even finds its way into other foods like <a href=#>potato chips</a>. They have a sweet and sour taste, thanks to the pickling, and a little bit of heat.<br>Take it from Sporked’s very own <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“pepperoncini queenie” Jordan Myrick</a>: These peppers are really good.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-are-pepperoncini-spicy><strong>Are pepperoncini spicy?</strong></h2><p>Pepperoncini are a very mild pepper, but they still do have a bit of a kick to them. On the infamous Scoville scale, pepperoncini rate anywhere from 100 to 500 scoville. Compared to a jalapeño, which clocks in anywhere from 2,500 to 8,000 scoville, the pepperoncini is a walk in the park. But compared to your standard bell pepper, which has a scoville of zero, it’s got a tad more zing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/DONT-SLEEP-ON-PEPPERONCINI_JORDAN-MYRICK_SPORKED_HEADER-1170x658.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-don-t-sleep-on-pepperoncini>Don’t Sleep On Pepperoncini</h2><p>You might be a pickle girl, but I am a pepperoncini queenie. Yes,&nbsp;pickles are perfect, but pepperoncini are for those ready to up their intake of zesty, tangy flavor.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-is-the-correct-pepperoncini-pronunciation><strong>What is the correct pepperoncini pronunciation?</strong></h2><p>Fun fact about me: I was a Classics major in college and I haven’t touched it since I graduated. I have no remaining knowledge of the Latin nor the ancient Greek that I learned almost 20 years ago. So, take all of this with a grain of salt.</p><p>In Italian, whenever the letter “c” is followed by an “e” or an “i” it makes the “ch” sound. This means the appropriate pronunciation is peh-per-un-CHEE-nee. This pronunciation is what you’ll usually hear in the United States.</p><p>In modern Greek, there is no letter “c.” It is usually replaced with a “k” or “ch,” which approximate the hard “c” sound. But for a soft “c” sound, the approximation is “ts.” So, in Greek the word may be pronounced pee-per-on-SEE-nee.&nbsp; Depending where you are, pronunciation may change.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-banana-peppers-vs-pepperoncini-what-s-the-difference><strong>Banana peppers vs pepperoncini: What’s the difference?</strong></h2><p>The banana pepper and pepperoncini can easily be mistaken for each other, thanks to their bright yellow color. However, there are several differences between the two.</p><p>The banana pepper is aptly named because it is long, smooth, and yellow with a rounded tip. The pepperoncini is short and squat by comparison, with wrinkled skin and a more pointed tip. If you plucked both of them off the vine and took a bite, they would have pretty similar tastes, except that the pepperoncini is slightly spicier. However, when commercially processed, the pepperoncini will be a little more sour thanks to the pickling.</p><p>Additionally, their countries of origin are different. The pepperoncini is decidedly Mediterranean while the banana pepper is an evolution of a traditional Hungarian pepper. Both are great with pizza; that is undeniable.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaK%2BYlsFutdJmmGaolaW9pr7Op5qipplk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-ca-bcs-t-i-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Whats T.i.
