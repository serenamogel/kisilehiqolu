I barely knew anyone there and on my day off, there was a snowstorm. I decided to walk to the theater in town and there was "Ice Castles." It was just the perfect combination of everything for my loneliness. I fell into a reverie. Yes, Robby's tighty whities helped. But there also was something about Lynn-Holly Johnson that was special. She felt authentic, both on the ice and off.</p><p><b>CHRISTY LEMIRE</b>: Because she wasn't a "great" actress. But I'm not sure she needed to be. You're right—there was a purity and naiveté to her that made her authentic.</p><p><b>SUSAN WLOSZCZYNA</b>: I just connected with her. Also, the milieu, given that I was in the Finger Lakes area in a small, working-class town.</p><p><b>SHEILA O’MALLEY</b>: I totally agree with this. She is sweet and sincere and quite believable, I thought, in some very difficult scenes (particularly the one with <a href=#>Colleen Dewhurst</a> in the attic).</p><p><b>CHRISTY LEMIRE</b>: And clearly they needed someone who could actually skate, but also could hold her own opposite those kinds of veterans. Right now, <a href=#>Margot Robbie</a> is training to play Tonya Harding, and while she has the acting part down, she has to learn how to skate—which is even harder, I think.</p><p><b>SHEILA O’MALLEY</b>: They also built in the fact that she was somewhat "behind" the other skaters. A little bit older, self-trained, not as polished. So it worked, I thought. She was good enough to make you believe that audiences would take to her.</p><p><b>SUSAN WLOSZCZYNA</b>: She wasn't a goody-goody girl, either. She had sass and ambition, but never in an obnoxious way. But, since she is 16, I did wonder, seeing the movie again, if she even went to school.</p><p><b>SHEILA O’MALLEY</b>: Can we talk about the score? I just re-watched it and had forgotten just how much Marvin Hamlisch's song was used as a motif throughout. It's sentimental, for sure, but dammit it works.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmnKCRr8BursuonmismKe8trPHZquhnV2axqa%2FjKidZqSfq7Juu81mq6GdXam2rrHLnqqsppWowG67xWagnJ1dmK60wMueqg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./alex-highsmith-biography-age-wiki-height-parents-education-girlfriend-highlights-family-salary-net-worth-and-career-2.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Alex Highsmith Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Parents, Education, Girlfriend, Highlights, Family, Sal</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./intel-unveils-meteor-lake-architecture-intel-4-heralds-the-disaggregated-future-of-mobile-cpus.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Intel 4 Heralds the Disaggregated Future of Mobile CPUs</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./emily-longnecker-wthr-bio-wiki-age-wedding-husband-salary-and-net-worth.html>Emily Longnecker WTHR Bio, Wiki, Age, Wedding, Husband, Salary and Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-do-you-get-a-banana-in-fruit-ninja-html.html>How do you get a banana in Fruit Ninja?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./january-jones-net-worth-2024.html>January Jones Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jim-starr-net-worth-3.html>Jim Starr Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./toosii-announces-u-s-headline-tour-in-support-of-his-debut-album-naujour-set-for-june-2-release.html></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX.
