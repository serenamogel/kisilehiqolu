It allows them to enjoy all the media attention and at the same time, be the center of all the controversy too.&nbsp;</p><p>The married couple, despite being at the center of attention, has successfully managed to keep their personal life under wraps. Today, we're going to try to explore more into their marital life. So, tag along.</p><h2>Wedding On the Romantic Day of The Year</h2><p><i>NRA</i>'s President Wayne tied the knot with Susan in a private ceremony. As of now, neither Susan nor Wayne has talked about their big day yet, but a leak of information suggests that they married on February.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/10/24/497D619600000578-5441347-NRA_chief_executive_LaPierre_and_his_wife_Susan_pictured_are_mor-a-61_1519757234980-1571901348517.jpg><p>Some online tabloids suggest that the power couple walked down the aisle in one of the most lovely days of the year. They said, 'I do' on the Valentines' Day of the late 90s. The information, however, is not confirmed by the Lapierre couple as of now.</p><p>The Lapierre couple is very proud of each other, especially on the work field, as they both advocate for gun access and rights. Besides this, Susan also holds a high position as a fundraiser for <i>Youth for Tomorrow</i> and <i>National Park Service. </i>Susan, who is a champion in fundraising just like <a href=#><strong>Charlotte Laws</strong></a> and has successfully raised millions as the funds.</p><h2>Wayne's Second Marriage</h2><p>The Lapierre couple is delighted in their married life. Before this, there is no information about Susan's past relationship. On the other hand, this is Wayne's second marriage.</p><p>Wayne was previously married to a woman for a long time who is kept mysterious as of now. It is not known the exact reason for the divorce between the pair yet, but sources claim that they went their separate ways in 1995.</p><h2>Do they Share any Children?</h2><p>As per reports, No, the couple do not share any children as of now. He is in a married relationship with his wife for a long time so, many would suppose the pair are already parents.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/10/24/b6aef709-774e-469d-bb42-c8da1ba5b5a7-getty-144863983-1571903715788.jpg><p>It looks like the 69-year-old never had any plans to raise a child. Not just that, Wayne also does not have any offsprings from his previous relationship.</p><p>Despite not expanding their family, the Lapierre couple seems to be relishing their super expensive lifestyle in a million-dollar mansion at Fairfax, Virginia. Like them, <a href=#><strong>Kristian Todd</strong></a> and her spouse is also living a luxurious lifestyle in Virginia.</p><h2>Any Personal Scandals?</h2><p>In her personal life, Susan is free from any controversies and rumors; however, she is surrounded by controversies in her professional life. In August 2019, many reports circulated that the <i>National Rifle Association</i> (NRA) paid for her hair and make-up stylist.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/10/24/x720-1571904145068.jpg><p>The amount published was tens of thousands of dollars, but both <i>NRA</i> and Susan justified the scandal saying the news was false. The sum of money went to different organizations for public events, as told by the <i>NRA</i>.</p><p>In addition to that, another news broke out, saying that NRA donated <strong>$180,000</strong> to Susan's foundation <i>Youth for Tomorrow</i> without reporting in their balance books. Besides Susan, Wayne also received many criticisms for his supporting statements for gun rights. He also got slammed by <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> after <a href=#><strong>NRA paid for the flight tickets of its executives.</strong></a></p><p>Despite surrounding by many scandals, the couple has never let their personal life get affected by it.&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>For further updates, stay tuned to </strong></i><a href=#><i><strong>MarriedCeleb</strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jqysrJmeYrmivMieqaudXZ3CtK7Ap5tmmZ6ZeqS0yKWbq52e</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./232349-blue-meanie-comments-on-jbl-fight-considering-lawsuit.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Blue Meanie Comments On JBL Fight; Considering Lawsuit?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./darren-drozdov-cause-of-death.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Darren Drozdov Cause Of Death, Age, Funeral, Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./emily-longnecker-wthr-bio-wiki-age-wedding-husband-salary-and-net-worth.html>Emily Longnecker WTHR Bio, Wiki, Age, Wedding, Husband, Salary and Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-do-you-get-a-banana-in-fruit-ninja-html.html>How do you get a banana in Fruit Ninja?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./january-jones-net-worth-2024.html>January Jones Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jim-starr-net-worth-3.html>Jim Starr Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./toosii-announces-u-s-headline-tour-in-support-of-his-debut-album-naujour-set-for-june-2-release.html></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX.
