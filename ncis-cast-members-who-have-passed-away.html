Spanning the course of two decades and counting, it’s no wonder the show has seen some cast changes. While some simply left the series to pursue other opportunities, the show has experienced other types of losses as well. Unfortunately, some of its cast members have passed away, leaving behind a legacy and their own unique imprint that will live on forever in fans’ hearts.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=663 data-current-count=663 data-injectable=true>NCIS takes its viewers on a journey through law and order procedures, military style. The team specializes in forensic crime scene analysis for any felony cases—most especially, murder—taking place under the watchful eye of the Navy and Marines. The show began in 2003 and continues today with spinoffs, including NCIS: Los Angeles, NCIS: New Orleans, and NCIS: Hawai’i. During its time on the air, seasoned alums have returned for victory laps and guest appearances. Unfortunately, some of the most beloved cast members of the show have left it all too soon for a variety of tragic reasons. Here are some of the NCIS cast members who have passed away.</p><h2 id=h-ralph-waite data-injectable=false>Ralph Waite</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ralph-waite.jpg><p data-characters=653 data-current-count=953 data-injectable=true>You may recognize Ralph Waite’s familiar face or name from the hit series The Waltons. A Hollywood alum, Waite starred in the hit series that first aired back in 1972, with him playing the lovable but firm patriarch, John Walton Sr. He was with the show for all nine seasons and the six subsequent movie specials. The Waltons cemented his place and legacy in Hollywood but it certainly wasn’t his only claim to fame. He has starred in several other shows and films including Roots, Cool Hand Luke, and Five Easy Pieces. He also dipped his toe into politics, running for Congress in California in the 1990s and narrowly losing to Sonny Bono.</p><p data-characters=338 data-current-count=338 data-injectable=false>He joined the NCIS cast as Jackson Gibbs, father to lead Leroy Jethro Gibb (played by Mark Harmon). He filmed eight episodes with the series before the character passed away in the season 11 episode “Honor Thy Father,” which aired ironically only three short months after Ralph Waite himself had passed away at the age of 85.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Gregory Itzin</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/itzin-3.jpg><p data-characters=198 data-current-count=198 data-injectable=false>Gregory Itzin’s acting is remembered for more reasons than one, but his ability to morph to fit various characters (often in the same show!) is legendary. His time with NCIS was no different.</p><p data-characters=586 data-current-count=784 data-injectable=true>Itzin actually played three different roles on the show throughout its time on the air, appearing in seasons 1 and 17. While this may seem like a far-fetched feat, for Itzin it was par for the course. He played a variety of characters on several shows including five different roles on Star Trek through its various sequels and spinoffs and played several different roles on Empty Nest, Night Court, and even The Practice. That is quite a résumé! He was also well known for his Grammy-winning role of Charlie Logan in the hit series 24 which would prove to be one of his final roles.</p><p data-characters=226 data-current-count=226 data-injectable=false>He passed away in 2022 at the age of 74 from post-surgery complications, as reported to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadline</a> by his family. His time on screen and his ability to shift between characters and roles with ease will be remembered and missed.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>David McCallum</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/mccullum.jpg><p data-characters=265 data-current-count=265 data-injectable=false>David McCallum was a fixture on NCIS, playing the beloved Doctor Donald “Ducky” Mallard for 461 episodes. In fact, it is hard to imagine NCIS without him. He had been with the show since its beginning and was the last original cast member on the show.</p><p data-characters=324 data-current-count=589 data-injectable=true>Prior to NCIS, McCallum already had a well-established career in Hollywood. It began all the way back in the 60s with his role as a Russian spy on the hit series The Man From U.N.C.L.E. He also appeared as a voice actor in several hit series such as Batman and had even more on-camera time in the series Sapphire and Steel.</p><p data-characters=304 data-current-count=304 data-injectable=false>While a born actor, this talented man actually played many roles including writer, narrator, and musician—including releasing four albums with Capitol Records. He will be sorely missed by those who knew him well and fans of NCIS alike. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">David McCallum passed away</a> in September of 2023 at the age of 90.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Terry Rhoads</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/rhoads-3.jpg><p data-characters=674 data-current-count=674 data-injectable=true>It seemed as though Terry Rhoads was born to play the doctor role, as he showed up as one in a variety of shows and series—his time on NCIS was no exception. He played Captain and Doctor Brent Peters in season 1 of the series, cementing his place in fan’s minds for years to come. He also played a doctor in several other series including Bones, That 70’s Show, Two And a Half Men, and Still Standing. Yet instead of bemoaning a typecast, Rhoads seemed to always show up on a set with a fresh perspective and unique addition to bring to the role. His career was very celebrated and many mourned the fact it was cut short in 2013 with his unfortunate passing.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Sam Sarpong</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/sarpong.jpg><p data-characters=459 data-current-count=759 data-injectable=true>Sam Sarpong was a guest star on NCIS but still very much considered a member of the cast family. Sarpong was a British actor who played a lot of roles and wore a lot of hats. He was also a model, singer, writer, and producer. In short, he was a busy guy. He appeared in several series and sitcoms including Family Matters, Bones, Everybody Hates Chris, and 24. He appeared in season 1 of NCIS and seemed to have a vision for what the show would later become.</p><p data-characters=199 data-current-count=199 data-injectable=false>Unfortunately at the age of 40, he reportedly died by suicide. His sister reported to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Daily Mail </a>“His passing is a loss for the world,” and we, along with his friends from NCIS agree.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Miguel Ferrer</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ferrer.jpg><p data-characters=335 data-current-count=335 data-injectable=false>Miguel Ferrer has many claims to fame, not the least of which is being the beloved cousin of major Hollywood actor George Clooney. Yet Ferrer certainly held his own in the Hollywood scene as he appeared in RoboCop and Passing Jordan, as well as holding down a spot on NCIS: Los Angeles for seven seasons as “Owen Granger.”</p><p data-characters=349 data-current-count=684 data-injectable=true>He was a very devoted and beloved member of the NCIS crew. Fans and cast alike were saddened by the news of his passing due to throat cancer in January 2017. At the time, Clooney made a statement on his cousin’s untimely death, saying “Miguel made the world brighter and funnier, and his passing is felt so deeply in our family.”</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Michael Gilden</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/gilden-2.jpg><p data-characters=332 data-current-count=632 data-injectable=true>Gilden made his appearance in season 4 of NCIS, as he played “Marty Pearson,” a scientist and the former love interest of Abigail Sciuto. He was in several episodes of the show before moving on to other opportunities. He made appearances in several shows such as The Amanda Show, Family Law, and Charmed, to name a few.</p><p data-characters=352 data-current-count=352 data-injectable=false>Gilden was very active and supportive in the Little People community. In fact, his wife was the first person with dwarfism to ever be on regular primetime television. She made history by joining the cast of Family Law. The two worked together to bring Little People’s causes to the forefront of viewer attention. Gilden died by suicide in 2006.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Heath Freeman</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Heath-Freeman.jpg><p data-characters=371 data-current-count=371 data-injectable=false>Heath Freeman was a fan favorite on NCIS. With his swarthy good looks and natural charm, he was a perfect fit for the role of Benjamin Frank. He then went on to star in the hit series Bones as Howard Epp and created quite a buzz in the role. Unfortunately, he passed away in 2021 from an accidental overdose. Fans and cast alike were devastated by the news and the loss.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Vachik Mangassarian</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/vachik-5.jpg><p data-characters=513 data-current-count=513 data-injectable=true>NCIS has been on for 20 seasons and counting, so it’s not surprising to see a few familiar faces. Some of the cast has not only come back a few times, but some of them have come back as different characters altogether. Vachik Mangassarian actually made three appearances on the show as three different characters, showing up twice in NCIS and once in NCIS: Los Angeles. To say he was a familiar face on the show would be an understatement. He was a series regular, always up for a guest appearance or spot.</p><p data-characters=175 data-current-count=175 data-injectable=false>He also made a name for himself in shows such as Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D. and Curb Your Enthusiasm. Mangassarian, unfortunately, passed away in 2022 due to Covid complications.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Ravil Isyanov</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ravil-3.jpg><p data-characters=366 data-current-count=366 data-injectable=false>Ravil Isyanov was a true fan favorite of the show. He made his debut in 2013 as tough guy mobster Anatoli Kirken on NCIS: Los Angeles. He was with the show until 2021. Unfortunately, as his health began to deteriorate, he let the producers know that his exit from the show would need to be imminent. The producers wrote him off the show with a dramatic death scene.</p><p data-characters=234 data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true>Isyanov also starred or made appearances in hit shows such as Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Jag, Prison Break, and 24. He was well-known in the Hollywood acting community, and he will be sorely missed. He passed away from cancer in 2021.</p><p data-characters=445 data-current-count=445 data-injectable=true>NCIS is a fan favorite that has held its place as one of TV’s longest-running series, with 20 seasons under its belt and a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">21st in the making</a>. While that comes with much acclaim and celebration, it can also come with the tragedy of losing members of the cast. These fan-favorite actors will be deeply missed by both the NCIS family and viewers but will all be remembered for their unique contributions to making the show what it is today.</p><p data-characters=1 data-current-count=1 data-injectable=false></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e82coKxlk5bAtXnMnqSbnaKoeri0zmafmq6VYr2iv9Kem2aZp5bGcA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ryden-shrock-net-worth-182097.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ryden Shrock Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./melinda-mack-obituary-death-new-york-association-executive-director-melinda-mack-dies-unexpectedly.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Melinda Mack Obituary Death: New York Association Executive Director, Melinda Mack Dies Unex</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./emily-longnecker-wthr-bio-wiki-age-wedding-husband-salary-and-net-worth.html>Emily Longnecker WTHR Bio, Wiki, Age, Wedding, Husband, Salary and Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-do-you-get-a-banana-in-fruit-ninja-html.html>How do you get a banana in Fruit Ninja?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./january-jones-net-worth-2024.html>January Jones Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jim-starr-net-worth-3.html>Jim Starr Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./toosii-announces-u-s-headline-tour-in-support-of-his-debut-album-naujour-set-for-june-2-release.html></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX.
