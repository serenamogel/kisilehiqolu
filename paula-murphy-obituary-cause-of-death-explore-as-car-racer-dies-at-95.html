Paula had been interested in racing since she was a teenager, but she pursued her racing career in California.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Paula-Murphy-2.jpg alt="Paula Murphy" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Paula chose to give up her desk job and dedicate herself totally to racing in 1963. In 1964, she participated in her first drag racing event, and the LA and Orange County Dealers Association awarded her an Olds 442.&nbsp;Paula had established a 61-mph women’s land-speed record in a Studebaker Avanti a year before her debut drag racing event. Paula began to be known as Miss STP after that recording-setting incident.&nbsp;After breaking the 200-mph barrier in 1968, Paula chose to retire from drag racing. Despite shattering the barrier, she kept racing.&nbsp;Murphy broke the NASCAR women’s close-course record in 1971 while driving the STP Dodge stock car. Murphy withdrew from racing after competing in the World Drive in 1976.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGinmq2clnquwdGpn7Jln5e2tcHAq7Bmm5GqwKZ5zp9knZ2RqbVusdepo6iqlWKutHnCmqlmqpGYsrN5w6KcrGWRqXp6gY4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./rod-taylor-htm.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Rod Taylor - Bio, Age, net worth, height, Wiki, Facts and Family</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./paige-spiranac-raunchy-augusta-towel-showing-off-boobs.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Paige Spiranac 'gives fans heart attack' as she releases VERY raunchy Augusta towel showing off her</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./emily-longnecker-wthr-bio-wiki-age-wedding-husband-salary-and-net-worth.html>Emily Longnecker WTHR Bio, Wiki, Age, Wedding, Husband, Salary and Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-do-you-get-a-banana-in-fruit-ninja-html.html>How do you get a banana in Fruit Ninja?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./january-jones-net-worth-2024.html>January Jones Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jim-starr-net-worth-3.html>Jim Starr Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./toosii-announces-u-s-headline-tour-in-support-of-his-debut-album-naujour-set-for-june-2-release.html></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX.
