He developed a frosty relationship with them both, which was only exacerbated after his father fell ill and died shortly after a quarrel with his son over a rumored affair with an actress. A grief-stricken Victoria never forgave her son, and she bristled over his well-deserved reputation as a pleasure-loving, decadent playboy. Victoria would have <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/royalty/queen-victoria-children-troubled-relationship data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="highly tempestuous relationships with all of her children" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">highly tempestuous relationships with all of her children</a>, who found themselves constantly battling for her love and acceptance.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Despite — or perhaps because of — his own painful upbringing, Edward proved to be a more caring father. He and his beautiful wife, Alexandra, bucked conventions of the era, especially among the upper class, spending ample time with their five surviving children and often refusing to punish them. The ever-critical Victoria cast a judgmental eye towards her rambunctious grandchildren, writing, “They are such ill-bred, ill-trained children.” Edward, remembering his own childhood, defended his and Alexandra’s parenting, writing to his mother, “If children are too strictly or perhaps too severely treated they get shy and only fear those whom they ought to love."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But Edward’s obvious affection for his children was countered by his notoriously short temper, and even those closest to him developed a wariness of getting on his wrong side. And his constant philandering and the pain it caused their beloved mother left his children, especially his second son George, with conflicted feelings for their father.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">George V proved to be very different from his father</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">An uninspiring student, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/royalty/george-v data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="George V" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">George V</a> followed his beloved elder brother, Eddy, into naval training as a young teen, where the once “ill-trained” child quickly grew to adore the regimented formality and discipline of military life. After his brother’s premature death in 1892, George married Eddy’s fiancée, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/royalty/mary-of-teck data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Mary of Teck" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Mary of Teck</a>, known as May.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The couple were devoted to each other, and they were determined to live a far more respectable life than George’s father, who became king following Queen Victoria’s death in 1901. Where Edward collected mistresses, his son developed a passion for collecting stamps. The charming, amiable king thrilled to visit the continent, where his fluency in several languages made him a beloved figure. His taciturn son considered foreign languages and travel frivolous, only rarely leaving England and his beloved game hunting.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">One of the most striking differences between Edward VII and George V was their parenting styles</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Although George had grown up in a permissive royal household, his own children were not so lucky. He was a demanding parent, whose quick temper (like his father’s) and strict military training made him a near martinet. His wife, May, was a somewhat more forgiving figure but admitted that she was emotionally ill-equipped to deal with her six children. The children saw their parents just twice a day and were primarily raised by nannies. George and May were so uninvolved in their children’s daily lives that it took them several years to discover that one nanny was inflicting emotional and sometimes physical abuse on the eldest boys, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/royalty/edward-viii data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Edward class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Edward</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/royalty/george-vi data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Albert class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Albert</a> (the future King George VI), known to family and friends as David and Bertie.</p><img alt="George VI, Edward VIII and Prince Henry" title="George VI, Edward VIII and Prince Henry" width=4000 height=5062 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/-king-george-vs-sons-prince-george-aka-future-george-vi-navy-lieutenant-edward-viii-prince-of-wales-air-vice-marshall-and-prince-henry-duke-of-gloucester-getty.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-wuot6e e1geg53v2">Photo: Getty Images</span><p>King George V’s sons</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">George V was particularly hard on these two sons</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Perhaps sensing echoes of his own worldly father, George harshly criticized Edward, who in time would develop a reputation as a stylish, capricious, cosmopolitan figure — not at all the solid, respectable heir George and May expected. Shy, Albert, meanwhile, proved to be no more promising in his parents’ eyes. He suffered from a series of digestive ailments and was knock-kneed, an abnormality that George fixed by forcing Albert to wear painful braces. The left-handed younger son was also forced to use his right hand, and George had little patience for the pronounced stammer that Albert developed as a young child, barking at him to speak up as the poor child struggled to choke out his words.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">George and May were also criticized over their treatment of their youngest child, John. An epileptic who was likely also developmentally challenged, John was eventually sent to live in his own household with a full-time caretaker. Although he lived on his family’s estate, his parents rarely visited him, and never spoke of him in public, as if to airbrush him from the history books. His brother George was one of the few family members to have contact with him before his death, aged just 13, in 1919.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A 1959 book by Randolph Churchill, son of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/winston-churchill data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Winston Churchill" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Winston Churchill</a>, attributed an infamous quote to George V: “My father was frightened of his mother. I was frightened of my father and I am damned well going to see to it that my children are frightened of me.” While the quote has proven to be apocryphal, it certainly sums up the multi-generational discord that ran through the family.</p><h2 data-node-id=21 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Albert and Edward reacted very differently to their strict upbringing</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">An almost emotionally shell-shocked Albert found the stability and support he craved with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/royalty/queen-mother-elizabeth data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon</a> (the future Queen Mother). A member of the British nobility, she and her nine siblings were raised in a warm, fun-loving and often prank-filled household. A popular debutante, she was reluctant to take on royal life, initially turning Albert’s proposal down before finally accepting. After their marriage in 1923, the couple settled down to they hoped would be a life of quiet domesticity, eventually joined by two daughters, the future Queen Elizabeth II and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/royalty/princess-margaret data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Princess Margaret" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Princess Margaret</a>. “We four,” as Albert would dub them, adored each other’s company, and his family proved to be a solace to him for the rest of his life.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Edward, however, refused to settle down. Affairs with a series of society women (many of them married) continued to infuriate his parents. His fastidious style and good looks made him a style icon. And although it would later be revealed that he harbored <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/royalty/edward-viii-wallis-simpson-nazi-sympathizers-hitler data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="disturbingly conservative views on race and class" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">disturbingly conservative views on race and class</a>, he was a popular Prince of Wales with the British public. Popular though he was, Edward chafed at his royal duties, or what he called, “princing.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Much like his grandfather Edward VII, he preferred the nightlife and lavish parties he threw at his home in Windsor. While he did have his admirers within the court, many found him capricious and weak-willed, and considerably vulnerable to the much more dominant women in his life, including American divorcée <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/celebrities/wallis-simpson data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Wallis Simpson" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Wallis Simpson</a>, who Edward met in the early 1930s. Friends, family and officials also whispered about Edward’s emotional intelligence, with many convinced he was nothing more than a stunted adult.</p><h2 data-node-id=26 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">George V despaired about his oldest child’s fitness to rule</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Government officials and royal courtiers had their doubts about Britain’s heir, but few were as openly dismissive about his fitness for the throne. George reportedly said that he hoped his eldest son would never have children, paving a path for the more dutiful (if dull) Albert to eventually reign. As George’s health began to decline, and with his eldest son nearing 40, he openly feared what came next, telling Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, “After I am dead, the boy will ruin himself in twelve months."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the end, of course, George proved to be right. Edward assumed the throne as Edward VIII in January 1936, following his father’s death. His mercurial behavior earned him few friends in government. Although his ongoing relationship Simpson was largely kept out of the British press, American newspapers covered it extensively. The Church of England, of which Edward was the head, categorically refused to consider his marriage to a now twice-divorced woman. The crisis came to a head that December, resulting in <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/royalty/edward-viii-abdicate-throne-wallis-simpson data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Edward’s abdication" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Edward’s abdication</a> less than a year after becoming king. Stammering, shy Albert, who had also chafed under his strong-willed father’s control, reluctantly became the dutiful king the family had wished for, ruling until his death in 1952 with the support of his loving family.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGipqLGRocG6e8SdrpqqlGLDqrXIZp6ep6Kcsm7CjJ6bsJmimXq3tciiZJ2hlpu2pMHLrWSrnZyWwaq7zayfoqg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tim-robbinss-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tim Robbinss Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mccandless-pa-car-accident-2-teenagers-killed-in-mccandless-crash.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mccandless PA Car Accident, 2 Teenagers Killed In McCandless Crash</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./emily-longnecker-wthr-bio-wiki-age-wedding-husband-salary-and-net-worth.html>Emily Longnecker WTHR Bio, Wiki, Age, Wedding, Husband, Salary and Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-do-you-get-a-banana-in-fruit-ninja-html.html>How do you get a banana in Fruit Ninja?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./january-jones-net-worth-2024.html>January Jones Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jim-starr-net-worth-3.html>Jim Starr Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./toosii-announces-u-s-headline-tour-in-support-of-his-debut-album-naujour-set-for-june-2-release.html></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX.
