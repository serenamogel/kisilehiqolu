Australia is the world’s 55th largest country with about 25 million people, but the Aussies are top 30 in the all-time Winter Olympics medal count and top 10 in the Summer Olympics.</p><p data-characters=226 data-current-count=226 data-injectable=false>In 1956, the Olympics were hosted by Australia, representing the first time the event had not been hosted in Europe or North America. The team finished a strong third place, only behind the United States and the Soviet Union.</p><p data-characters=260 data-current-count=486 data-injectable=true>This prompted new interest in Olympic sports around the country, particularly in winter sports that had not been popular in Australia to date. In 1960, Australia sent the largest team it ever had to a Winter Olympics in hopes of competing on the highest stage.</p><p data-characters=228 data-current-count=228 data-injectable=false>It did not go well. Certainly not for the men’s hockey team, who lost all six of their games and conceded 83 goals in the process. Australia had never won a medal in the Winter Games, and that didn’t change in 1960.</p><p data-characters=307 data-current-count=535 data-injectable=true>This led to a downturn on the winter side of the Olympic program, as fewer athletes were sent to compete in 1964 than ever before. The generally more popular summer sports were still thriving, but Australians would have to wait until the 1990s to see their country’s first-ever Winter Olympics medal.</p><p data-characters=361 data-current-count=361 data-injectable=false>That day came in 1994, when Steven Bradbury, Kieran Hansen, Andrew Murtha and Richard Nizielski took home bronze medals in the men’s speed skating 5000m relay. Zali Steggali added another bronze in the women’s slalom in ’98, and in 2002 Bradbury took home Australia’s first Winter gold medal in the men’s speed skating 1000m race.</p><p data-characters=299 data-current-count=660 data-injectable=true>This was the dawn of a new era for Australia, now having 15 medals in the Winter Games and regularly contending in events like skiing and snowboarding. Considering the amount of investment behind this newly successful program, Australia has a bright future ahead for the Summer and Winter Olympics.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Gum-Tree Green and Wattle-Gold</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/why-are-australias-olympic-colors-green-and-yellow-soccer.png><p data-characters=267 data-current-count=567 data-injectable=true>Australia’s history with green and yellow is as old as its Olympic history. One of the first recorded instances of an Australian team sporting the colors was in 1899, when a cricket team touring England decided to buy matching caps and blazers for the players.</p><p data-characters=281 data-current-count=281 data-injectable=false>This tradition continued until 1908 when green and yellow were officially selected as the colors of Australian cricket, being described by the New South Wales Cricket Association as “gum-tree green and wattle-gold,” referring to two plants indigenous to the continent.</p><p data-characters=223 data-current-count=504 data-injectable=true>Green and yellow continued to be a popular color combination in the 20th century, but it was not the only one favored by Australians. Many teams wore blue and gold, more keeping in line with the colors on the national flag.</p><p data-characters=335 data-current-count=335 data-injectable=false>Eventually, Australian officials stepped in to decide on a color scheme that the whole country could get behind. After years of debate, in 1984 Governor-General Sir Ninian Stevens declared “that green and gold shall be the national colours of Australia for use on all occasions on which such colours are customarily used.”</p><p data-characters=182 data-current-count=517 data-injectable=true>From time to time, you will still see an Australian team with some dark blue on their jersey, but for the most part the nation is united behind their gum-tree green and wattle-gold.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false></p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmejpbyzwNJorqGxXZa%2FpnnArqqtqpGhtqK%2FjKijsqWgnrBur86lpqurXZy%2FprHNZpinnF2usq24zrBm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./cody-cocomelon-sister-name-meet-kendi.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Cody Cocomelon Sister Name; Meet Kendi</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./where-can-i-get-the-marvels-amc-flerkitten-popcorn-and-cup-collectible.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Where can I get The Marvels AMC Flerkitten popcorn and cup collectible?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./emily-longnecker-wthr-bio-wiki-age-wedding-husband-salary-and-net-worth.html>Emily Longnecker WTHR Bio, Wiki, Age, Wedding, Husband, Salary and Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-do-you-get-a-banana-in-fruit-ninja-html.html>How do you get a banana in Fruit Ninja?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./january-jones-net-worth-2024.html>January Jones Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jim-starr-net-worth-3.html>Jim Starr Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./toosii-announces-u-s-headline-tour-in-support-of-his-debut-album-naujour-set-for-june-2-release.html></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX.
