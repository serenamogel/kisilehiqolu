Notably, NBC’s concert lineup has included popular artists like Rihanna, One Reupublic, and Harry Styles, while Fox & Friends lineup has included artists like Josh Turner, Donny Osmond, and Lifehouse. If you’re curious who’s playing this year’s concert series or wondering which one to watch, here are the details you need to know (and as a bonus, which one I’d actually consider going to).</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fox-friends-summer-concert-series-2023 data-injectable=false>Fox & Friends Summer Concert Series 2023</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Fox-and-Friends-Summer-Concert.png><p data-characters=675 data-current-count=975 data-injectable=true>Fox & Friends summer concert series is hosted by the show’s co-hosts Steve Doocy, Ainsley Earhardt, and Brian Kilmeade and like last year, will take place in the Fox Square right outside FNC’s New York City headquarters. Shows will take place throughout the summer starting May 26 until September 1, with the last two concert performers yet to be determined. This year, the concert series is sponsored by home improvement store Lowe’s, and will be available to stream through your cable provider or live on Fox Nation. Each concert is free of charge, and the Fox News website recommends traveling by subway if you plan on attending.

As you might expect from the name, the Citi Music Series is sponsored by Citi Bank and the concerts are free to attend. If you’re interested in attending any of the upcoming concerts, you can apply for a free Fan Pass on The Today Show‘s website, which will grant you guaranteed admission to the concert of your choice. If you’re not able to get a Fan Pass, don’t fret; each Citi Concert has a general admission line you can join the morning of.</p><p data-characters=223 data-current-count=223 data-injectable=false>The Citi Music Series began earlier this May with a performance by the Jonas Brothers as they promoted their newest album, aptly titled The Album, but will pick back up the first week of June.

Both lineups have artists I’d consider seeing live (I was partial to Colbie Caillat as a preteen), but the Citi Music Series smashes it out the park for me personally. This lineup is a great mix of nostalgia and popular acts — and with the added bonus of not airing on a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">network that pushes conspiracy theories as news</a> — while representing several genres of music. There’s something for everyone (but especially me — I enjoy songs from pretty much every artist on this list) and it’s even free, which is definitely a consideration given<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> how steadily concert ticket prices have been rising</a>. For fans of artists like TWICE, who are performing at the nearby MetLife Stadium shortly after their Today Show performance, this can be an affordable alternative to shelling out your savings for concert tickets. I’ll be watching from home, but if you’re in New York, you should definitely consider checking these out in person.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedqsCqr46fprFlkaOxbrLRopynnKNiw7R5zZuarGWkpLGixYysn6ivXZa5rXnAq6uiq6SoerGx0Z%2Bmq6WZo7Rutc1mq6Gdmad6tMHMppyrZZOku6Sx0a1krJ2inrK0ew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./stone-phillips.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Stone Phillips</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-real-reason-jojo-is-speaking-out-about-race.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Real Reason JoJo Is Speaking Out About Race</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./emily-longnecker-wthr-bio-wiki-age-wedding-husband-salary-and-net-worth.html>Emily Longnecker WTHR Bio, Wiki, Age, Wedding, Husband, Salary and Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-do-you-get-a-banana-in-fruit-ninja-html.html>How do you get a banana in Fruit Ninja?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./january-jones-net-worth-2024.html>January Jones Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jim-starr-net-worth-3.html>Jim Starr Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./toosii-announces-u-s-headline-tour-in-support-of-his-debut-album-naujour-set-for-june-2-release.html></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX.
