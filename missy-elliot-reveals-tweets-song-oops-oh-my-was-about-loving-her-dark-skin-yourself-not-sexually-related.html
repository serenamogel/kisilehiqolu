MISSY!! Cut out all this fibbin. You know good’n hell well…” They added, “So, now ‘One Minute Man’ was about a dude running a foot race??” Missy replied back to the fan, saying, “Lol! Nah that song meant what it said.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Lol! Nah that song meant what it said🤣😂</p>— Missy Elliott (@MissyElliott) <a href=#>January 5, 2021</a></figure><p>Another person tried to assist Missy and shared a clip of Tweet’s episode on the BET digital series “Finding,” in which she explained how the song came about. In the nearly two-minute clip, Tweet explained that Missy played the beat for her, and she automatically started singing lyrics from a song she wrote for another project. “Oops is about self-love,” the songstress explained. “I remember watching ‘Oprah,’ and there was a doctor on there that said, ‘everybody in life should get naked and look at themselves in the mirror and love everything they see about themselves not wanting to change a thing.'” The 49-year-old revealed she kept that thought stored away, and it was that clip that inspired her to write the song.</p><p>The video then panned to a vintage interview, where DJ Clue specifically asked her if the song was about something sexual, to which the songstress replied, “No, I’m positive.” She added, “It’s about self-love and appreciation; you know I was real insecure about myself for a while.”</p><p>Tweet said she was taught in the music industry that sex sells and figured it was a creative way to say “love yourself.” She added, “If people think it’s about that, whatever interpretation you want. That just means you listened.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Very true and here’s <a href=#>@MS_HUMMINGBIRD</a> speaking on the record. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ZpcepWHnhF</a></p>— Zion (@ZionNtsekwa) <a href=#>January 5, 2021</a></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX9ye49qZmltX6K2tL%2FYZpylpJmkwW6%2BxK%2BcmqSjYsG4scStqmarn6O0brvOqapmp5hiurp51pqqZpmSpMK1ecuoraKml2K1pr6MnZiro12ouKq6jLKmrqqjmrmnec2oq2arla3CorjLsmSrnZyWwaawjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sacredalmighty-net-worth-318712.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>SacredAlmighty Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./navarone-garibaldi.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>His Net Worth, Father &amp;amp; Wedding</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./emily-longnecker-wthr-bio-wiki-age-wedding-husband-salary-and-net-worth.html>Emily Longnecker WTHR Bio, Wiki, Age, Wedding, Husband, Salary and Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-do-you-get-a-banana-in-fruit-ninja-html.html>How do you get a banana in Fruit Ninja?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./january-jones-net-worth-2024.html>January Jones Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jim-starr-net-worth-3.html>Jim Starr Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./toosii-announces-u-s-headline-tour-in-support-of-his-debut-album-naujour-set-for-june-2-release.html></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX.
