After a brief illness, Napolitano died on Saturday in New York City. At the time, he was 33 years old.</strong></p><p>Napolitano joined Fox News in 2015, originally as a writer on the Sirius XM show Fox News Headlines 24/7. Because of his swift growth, he became a sports reporter for the same channel. He left the network as a full-time employee in 2022 but returned in November of that year, coinciding with Fox News’ heightened efforts to build its audio content projects.</p><p>Napolitano worked for Fox News as an anchor and correspondent, developing and producing content for all audio platforms. In addition, he covered sports for the Fox Business Network’s daily “Cavuto: Coast to Coast” show, hosted by Neil Cavuto. In addition, Napolitano gave commentary for Fox News Edge, which delivers news coverage and multimedia packages to Fox affiliate stations around the country.</p><h2>Mete Ricky Whitcomb, Matt Napolitano’s Husband</h2><p>Matt Napolitano is survived by his husband, whom he married on May 27, 2023. Ricky Whitcomb, his husband, earned a degree in theater production from Stony Brook University in 2006.</p><p>Whitcomb formerly worked as an event organizer at StarQuest International Inc. from August 2014 until June 2018. He served as a stage coordinator at the AV Workshop from August 2018 until July 2019. He later served as the New York Conservatory for Dramatic Arts’ technology services coordinator from July to October 2019.</p><p>He was the director of event technology and technical director of Sns Staging before November 2022. The couple made their LGBT identity very public and shared glimpses of their lives together, including times of pleasure and pride. Whitcomb’s delight at Napolitano’s accomplishments was emphasized in one of their shared moments with the words “just my husband crushing it on national television.”</p><h2>Ricky Whitcomb’s Husband, Napolitano Dies At 33</h2><p>Napolitano’s husband, Ricky Whitcomb, confirmed his wife’s death on X. Whitcomb wrote in one of his notes that Napolitano died as a result of an illness after fighting an autoimmune ailment diagnosed roughly two decades earlier. Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott applauded Napolitano’s journalistic zeal and adaptability.</p><p>Scott stated this in a statement to Fox News workers on December 24.</p><p><strong>“Matt did everything from anchoring to writing and producing for our audio platforms and loved being able to work in the journalism field that he trained for his entire life.”</strong></p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Jonathan Groff, Who Is Out Gay, Discusses A Relationship Gone Wrong"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/jonathan-groff-who-is-out-gay-discusses-a-relationship-gone-wrong/"}{"1":78}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Jonathan Groff, Who Is Out Gay, Discusses A Relationship Gone Wrong</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Trending News</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>All About Family Of Matthew Mcgreevy</a></h3>Matthew Mcgreevy is a former office runner whose popularity skyrocketed after he was associated with British television host Phillip Schofield.
