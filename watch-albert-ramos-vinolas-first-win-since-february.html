The Spaniard played some exciting tennis, giving him the edge to go out and grab the much-needed win.</strong></p><p>The 35-year-old currently sits at number 60 on the ATP Rankings and has had a career-high of rank 17. His Belarusian competitor sits just nine places behind him, at rank 69, with a career-high of No. 40.</p><p>Ramos-Vinolas has had a challenging year so far, with his last win coming in February, which came at the Rio Open. He defeated Daniel Elahi Galan in the round of 16 with a confident 6-2,6-4 win over the No. 1 Colombian player.</p><p>His recent match saw him overcome his brutal losing streak after defeating Ivashka 4-6, 7-6, 6-2. The pair produced an exciting two hours and 58 minutes before the Spaniard grabbed his ticket to advance into the next round.</p><p>This was a surprising win for the Spaniard, as his competitor had won three out of his last six matches, as opposed to his zero wins from his previous six matches. The match saw some impressive strikes, with both players winning some big points.</p><p>After winning his fourth game of the second set Ramos-Vinolas celebrated with a vicious cry to help motivate him to secure the win. “Oh, what a strike. Urging himself on here,” remarked the commentator.</p><p>The Spaniard was able to grab his first set of the match with a brilliant backhand that was too powerful for his opponent to return. Leaving the commentator to say, “A fine effort from Albert Ramos-Vinolas, who’s looking for his first win since February; and looking to end a run of seven defeats on the bounce.” This will surely help give the Spaniard a confidence boost as he looks to push on to the final.</p><p>Ramos-Vinolas bathed in the glory of ending his losing streak, with the commentator adding, “That’s a very welcomed win for Albert Ramos-Vinolas. A first win, in fact, since February.” A proud moment for the Spaniard, who received a standing ovation from the supporters.</p><p>Ramos-Vinolas is set to face fellow Spaniard 29th seed Alejandro Davidovich Fokina on Friday. The 35-year-old will have to produce some excellent tennis if he is to defeat Davidovich Fokina, who sits 25 places in front of him at rank 35 and has a career-high of No. 24.</p><p>The pair have faced each other twice in their career, with both players winning one each. This will undoubtedly bring us an exciting match, as the players will look to break the deadlock.</p><p>READ MORE: <a href=#><strong>Fun facts about the Madrid Open that you probably didn’t know</strong></a></p><p>If you want to follow up on some more tennis excitement or live updates <a rel="nofollow noopener" href=#><strong>WATCH MORE ATP CONTENT HERE</strong>.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHNp6Csa2Zqe6S7zGirnqaensBuwsidnKirX6yuta%2FHZpilmpWnwW6%2BwKamrGWmnruwuMCsZJ%2BhoqjBbsPIp2SsoZ6Ysm6yxJuprpmirg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./fernando-gaviria.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fernando Gaviria- Bio, Age, Net Worth, Girlfriend, Height, Career</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lil-dicky.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Lil Dicky Height, Weight, Body Measurements, Shoe Size</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./emily-longnecker-wthr-bio-wiki-age-wedding-husband-salary-and-net-worth.html>Emily Longnecker WTHR Bio, Wiki, Age, Wedding, Husband, Salary and Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-do-you-get-a-banana-in-fruit-ninja-html.html>How do you get a banana in Fruit Ninja?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./january-jones-net-worth-2024.html>January Jones Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jim-starr-net-worth-3.html>Jim Starr Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./toosii-announces-u-s-headline-tour-in-support-of-his-debut-album-naujour-set-for-june-2-release.html></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX.
