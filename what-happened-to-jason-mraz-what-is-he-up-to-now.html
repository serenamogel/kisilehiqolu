There is no doubt that he was quite the hotshot for a minute back there as he gained major recognition from the right quarters. His albums frequented the Billboard 100 and 200 charts and he sold copy after copy. In addition to that, he has won two Grammys, been nominated for two more and bagged a Teen’s Choice Award, among several more. The success he has enjoyed in his booming career has put him in the spotlight a lot with fans keeping tabs on him. So, what exactly is the star up to these days? Sit tight and find out all about it here.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-jason-mraz></span><strong>Who is Jason Mraz?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Before we delve into what happened to Jason Mraz, let’s go back to where it all started. He was born on June 23, 1977, in a town called Mechanicsville, Virginia. He has a very interesting racial cocktail as the star happens to be of Czech and Slovak descent through his grandfather’s lineage. Granddaddy Mraz moved from Austria-Hungary to the United States as far back as 1915. His own parents are Tomas Mraz and June Tomes and the two divorced when Jason was just five years old. While his dad is a postal worker, his mother happens to be the vice president at one of the branches of the Bank of America.</p><p>Despite the divorce that separated his parents, Jason recounts that his childhood was not all that bad. In fact, growing up in the idyllic town of Mechanicsville had him experiencing a very peaceful childhood altogether. During his high school days, he had already built an affinity to performing. So, it is no surprise that he was a member of the cheerleading squad, drama club, and the school chorus. The real magic started after high school when the star attended the American Musical and Dramatic Academy in New York City. From New York, he moved to the Shockoe Bottom neighborhood of Richmond, Virginia but that was not the point where he had a fully realized music career, in fact, he took on several odd jobs to survive.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-happened-to-jason-mraz></span><strong>What Happened To Jason Mraz?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The great news here is that Jason’s career is not over, the star is still active and getting what is his. As recently as 2017, he appeared in the documentary Dreadtown which was directed by Yonathan Gal. The project tells the story of Steel Pulse which happens to be a British Raggae group which gained its prominence in the ’70s. The documentary also featured big names like Snoop Dog, Matt Groening, Chad Smith, and Billy Idol. Interestingly, it was all filmed in Port-au-Prince which is in Haiti. Also in 2017, he went on to co-star in another documentary known as Enormous: The Gorge Story. This particular production focused on George Amphitheatre which is one of the world’s most legendary music venues.</p><p>Anyone looking to find out more about what happened to Jason Mraz can simply check out his social media accounts where he shares memories with his fans. On Twitter, he uses the handle @jason_mraz while on Facebook his fan page is titled JasonMraz.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-jason-mraz-up-to-now></span><strong>What Is Jason Mraz&nbsp;Up To Now?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>These days, he is living out his days with his wife Christina Carano who he married in 2015. Besides that, he is a proud vegan and has even gone as far as to monetize it. Jason happens to own a five and a half acre avocado farm located in Oceanside, California. In addition to that, he is an investor at Cafe Gratitude which is a vegan restaurant in Los Angeles.</p><p>Jason is also very much involved in advocating for the LGBT community, which he now identifies with. He actually came out and said that he identifies as bisexual. Based on that information, it is not surprising that he wrote a love letter to the LGBT community as part of a Billboard feature during gay pride month. So, these days he is more of an activist than an artist, but his fans love him anyway.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYlsFutMCpp56mlZl6tbuMo5isp55iurOt2WauoZmkYra0eceeZK6oXam8brrOsGY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mccandless-pa-car-accident-2-teenagers-killed-in-mccandless-crash.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mccandless PA Car Accident, 2 Teenagers Killed In McCandless Crash</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./is-the-hvac-business-profitable.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Is the HVAC business profitable?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./emily-longnecker-wthr-bio-wiki-age-wedding-husband-salary-and-net-worth.html>Emily Longnecker WTHR Bio, Wiki, Age, Wedding, Husband, Salary and Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-do-you-get-a-banana-in-fruit-ninja-html.html>How do you get a banana in Fruit Ninja?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./january-jones-net-worth-2024.html>January Jones Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jim-starr-net-worth-3.html>Jim Starr Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./toosii-announces-u-s-headline-tour-in-support-of-his-debut-album-naujour-set-for-june-2-release.html></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX.
