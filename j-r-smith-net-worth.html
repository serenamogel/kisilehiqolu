Smith's Net Worth?</strong></h2><p>J.R. Smith is an American former professional basketball player who has a net worth of $35 million. J.R. Smith is probably best-known as a member of the Cleveland Cavaliers, with whom he won an NBA Championship in 2016 alongside <a href=# title="LeBron James Net Worth">LeBron James</a>.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Earl Joseph "J.R." Smith III was born on September 9, 1985, in Freehold Borough, New Jersey. He grew up in the Clarksburg section of Millstone Township and spent five years in high school. He attended Steinert High for the first semester of his freshman year and then McCorristin Catholic High for the next. He was permitted to transfer to Lakewood High having not participated in sports for either school where he repeated his freshman year. J.R. played two seasons of basketball for the school before moving on to Saint Benedict's Preparatory School in 2002. He became a highly rated football and baseball player, but he focused strictly on basketball as a senior. Smith committed to the University of North Carolina after a long recruiting battle, but after winning co-MVP with <a href=# title="Dwight Howard Net Worth">Dwight Howard</a> at the 2004 McDonald's All-American Game, decided to forgo college and enter the NBA Draft.</p><h2 id=nba-career><strong>NBA Career</strong></h2><p>With the 18th overall pick in the 2004 NBA Draft, the Charlotte Hornets selected J.R. Smith. He spent two years with the Hornets. He played moderately well, earning Western Conference Rookie of the Month honors three times during his first year with the team. He was traded to the Denver Nuggets in 2006. He played well for the team setting a franchise record for the number of successful three-pointers (11) during a single game. He spent one year with the Zhejiang Golden Bulls in Asia in 2011. He reportedly signed a $3 million, one-year deal to play with the Golden Bulls, a single-season record for a Chinese league contract at that time. In June 2011, he sued the Golden Bulls for failing to pay $1 million in salary. The team claims they withheld his salary for missing practices and faking an ankle injury.</p><p>Smith returned to the NBA to play for the New York Knicks ahead of the 2012 season. In 2013, he was named NBA Sixth Man of the Year.</p><p>Smith joined the Cleveland Cavaliers in January of 2015 as the result of a three-team trade involving the Knicks and Oklahoma City Thunder. He was instrumental in the team sweeping the Hawks to reach the NBA Finals where they fell short to the Golden State Warriors in six games. In 2016, J.R. Smith started all of Cleveland's playoff games once again helping them to the NBA Finals against the Golden State Warriors. This time, the Cavaliers won the series in seven games for the franchise's first NBA Championship after overcoming a 3-1 deficit.</p><p>Smith struggled the next year, and when LeBron James left the team in free agency to head to the Los Angeles Lakers, J.R. joined him after being waived by the Cavs in July of 2019. He won his second NBA Championship when the Lakers defeated the Miami Heat in six games.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-148584 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/J.R.-Smith.jpg alt="J.R.

He signed a two-year, $10.4 million deal with the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2015, and then a three-year, $57 million contract with the team in 2016.</p><p>Over the course of his 18-year NBA career, J.R. Smith earned more than $90.2 million in salary alone.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>J.R. Smith married Jewel Harris in August of 2016, and the couple has three daughters together. Smith also has one daughter from a previous relationship.</p><p>During his playing days, Smith was known as perhaps the most heavily tattooed player in the league saying he lost count around "70 something." He modeled for Mike and Supreme in 2018 and had the Supreme logo tattooed on his calf.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6osDHpZytnaNku6OtjqNkq2Wjora1tIynnK1lp6S%2FtbSO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./best-movies-2024.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Best Movies and Mini-Series of 2024 | Page 3</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./isabelle-connolly.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Isabelle Connolly movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./emily-longnecker-wthr-bio-wiki-age-wedding-husband-salary-and-net-worth.html>Emily Longnecker WTHR Bio, Wiki, Age, Wedding, Husband, Salary and Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-do-you-get-a-banana-in-fruit-ninja-html.html>How do you get a banana in Fruit Ninja?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./january-jones-net-worth-2024.html>January Jones Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jim-starr-net-worth-3.html>Jim Starr Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./toosii-announces-u-s-headline-tour-in-support-of-his-debut-album-naujour-set-for-june-2-release.html></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX.
