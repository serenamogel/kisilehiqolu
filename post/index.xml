Barn Owls are birds of prey, also known as raptors, who are specialised hunters at the top of the food chain, which means that they must consume prey animals in order to live. Barn Owls are found in the United States and Canada. Prey animals, which are mostly tiny mammals, prey on other smaller species as well as plants, seeds, and fruits, among other things.
