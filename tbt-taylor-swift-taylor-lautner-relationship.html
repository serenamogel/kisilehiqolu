Lautner and Swift were both teens who reached a staggering level of fame in a relatively short timeframe and were still sort of figuring out what that meant. In that way, they were kind of perfect for each other — but as friends, not lovers.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here's a look back at Taylor Swift and Taylor Lautner's relationship.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-july-2009-taylor-swift-and-taylor-lautner-first-meet></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>July 2009: Taylor Swift and Taylor Lautner first meet</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">ICYMI:&nbsp;Swift attempted to get a role in&nbsp;Twilight&nbsp;but was ultimately denied. However, the Twihard would not have to wait long before she got her revenge — by meeting Jacob Black. Lautner and Swift presumably met on the set of the ensemble rom-com&nbsp;Valentine's Day&nbsp;in summer of 2009 when they were 17 and 19, respectively. In the film, the Taylors (aka Willy and Felicia) played high school sweethearts.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-september-2009-taylor-lautner-presents-taylor-swift-with-a-vma></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>September 2009: Taylor Lautner presents Taylor Swift with a VMA</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Kevin Mazur / Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lautner was present for pop culture's defining moment of 2009.

As evidenced by their hockey game and fro-yo outings, dinner dates, and concert events, it seemed likely the pair were an item off-screen.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-november-7-2009-taylor-swift-hosts-snl-and-jokes-about-dating-taylor-lautner></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>November 7, 2009: Taylor Swift hosts SNL and jokes about dating Taylor Lautner</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Jean Baptiste Lacroix / Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When the pop culture icon hosted&nbsp;SNL&nbsp;for the first time, she opened it up with a monologue song that jokingly addressed her relationship with Lautner.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"If you're wondering if I might be dating the werewolf from Twilight ..." she sang before seemingly mouthing "Hi Taylor" at the camera and blowing a kiss, "I'm not going to comment on that in my monologue."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-december-12-2009-taylor-lautner-hosts-snl-and-mentions-taylor-swift></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>December 12, 2009: Taylor Lautner hosts SNL and mentions Taylor Swift</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A month or so later, the&nbsp;Abduction&nbsp;actor had his chance to address his relationship with Swift and even redeem himself after that infamous night at the VMAs. He reenacted an alternate ending of him standing up for his then-girlfriend by karate-chopping West.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-december-2009-taylor-swift-and-taylor-lautner-break-up></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>December 2009: Taylor Swift and Taylor Lautner break up</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">By late December,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Us Weekly&nbsp;reported</a>&nbsp;the young lovebirds called it quits. According to a "source close to Swift," the relationship "wasn't really developing into anything," and "there was no chemistry."&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"He liked her more than she liked him. He went everywhere he could to see her, but she didn't travel much to see him," the source told the outlet.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The following October, Swift released the single "Back to December," which was immediately assumed to be about Lautner. The song described a wintertime incident (aka breakup) between a former couple, featuring these lyrics: "So this is me swallowing my pride / Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night / And I go back to December all the time / It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you / Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">One week ahead of the song's release, Swift told&nbsp;Glamour&nbsp;that Lautner was still one of her "best friends." Around that same time, she revealed to&nbsp;Ladies' Home Journal&nbsp;(<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>via MTV News</a>) that Lautner was "always going to be" her crush.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The feelings appear to be mutual on Lautner's side as well. In 2016, during a&nbsp;Scream Queens&nbsp;press op that turned into a T-Swift-themed interrogation, the&nbsp;Twilight&nbsp;alum confirmed that "Back to December" was written about him,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>according to&nbsp;Elle</a>. He also told co-star&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>John Stamos</a>&nbsp;that dating Swift had been a "good time," adding, "It was a fun few months there."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-february-12-2010-taylor-swift-and-taylor-lautners-film-valentines-day-premieres></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>February 12, 2010: Taylor Swift and Taylor Lautner's film, Valentine's Day, premieres</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Watching the Taylors as two lovesick teens making out on the football field in&nbsp;Valentine's Day&nbsp;(the film where they reportedly first met) was a beautiful way to conclude the brief Swift-Lautner era — or prolong it. The film, released in February 2010 ahead of the holiday, outlived the young couple's relationship.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-july-8-2023-taylor-swift-and-taylor-lautner-reunite></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>July 8, 2023: Taylor Swift and Taylor Lautner reunite</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since their relationship ended, Swift and Lautner have remained on good terms. Lautner even starred alongside Joey King and Presley Cash in a music video for Swift's song, "I Can See You," from her&nbsp;Speak Now (Taylor's Version)&nbsp;album.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Swift premiered the video during a performance, with Lautner, King, and Cash joining her,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>reported&nbsp;Entertainment Tonight</a>. After the concert, the Taylors — including Swift and Lautner and his wife (who, ironically, shares the actor's name since they wed in 2022) — continued the fun by recreating the famous Spider-Man pointing meme. Apparently, that's what friends and romantic partners (past and present) named Taylor do.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zZ6urGekl8FuwMCyo6iqXajEqrLTZquasZykv264wK6rp52iYr%2BmuMCtoKimo522sQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./adrian-dingle-net-worth-2024.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Adrian Dingle Net Worth 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mark-ruffalo-is-thrilled-she-hulk-has-him-get-his-ass-kicked-for-mansplaining.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mark Ruffalo is thrilled She-Hulk has him get his ass kicked for mansplaining</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./emily-longnecker-wthr-bio-wiki-age-wedding-husband-salary-and-net-worth.html>Emily Longnecker WTHR Bio, Wiki, Age, Wedding, Husband, Salary and Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-do-you-get-a-banana-in-fruit-ninja-html.html>How do you get a banana in Fruit Ninja?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./january-jones-net-worth-2024.html>January Jones Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jim-starr-net-worth-3.html>Jim Starr Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./toosii-announces-u-s-headline-tour-in-support-of-his-debut-album-naujour-set-for-june-2-release.html></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX.
