These classic muffins are bursting with fresh citrus flavor, and they have a moist, tender texture that’s punctuated by the poppy seeds’ crunch. I love them plain for breakfast or an afternoon snack, but they’re also wonderful with my quick lemon glaze on top. It makes them a bakery-worthy treat that would be perfect for a special occasion brunch or even dessert. Like all my muffin recipes, these lemon poppy seed muffins are easy to make. You simply stir together the batter in a couple of mixing bowls. No mixer required!

They deliver all the best qualities of oven roasted potatoes, but they cook in a fraction of the time (we’re talking under 20 minutes!). These air fryer potatoes are the perfect weeknight side dish. They’re quick and delicious—crispy on the outside, creamy in the middle, and packed with savory garlic flavor. Even picky eaters love them. These air fryer potatoes pair nicely with so many main dishes (find serving suggestions below!). Versatile, flavorful, and fast, they’ll become a new favorite in your recipe rotation.

They’re crisp and crumbly around the edges, perfect for pairing with a cup of coffee or tea. Scones can get a bad rap for being bland or dry (my husband Jack swore he didn’t like them for years), but when they’re prepared well, they shouldn’t be either of those things. I’m sharing my favorite blueberry scones recipe below.&nbsp;It’s easy to make with 10 basic ingredients, and it yields tender, flavorful, bakery-worthy scones every time. If you’re on the fence about scones, I think it’ll win you over. Even Jack will tell…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This homemade lemon curd is so delicious that you’ll want to eat it off a spoon. It’s rich, sweet, and delightfully tart, bursting with bright citrus flavor. Imagine if the top of a lemon bar or the middle of a lemon meringue pie became a smooth and creamy spread. That’s this lemon curd. As the world’s biggest fan of anything lemon, I’ve always loved lemon curd. But I didn’t try making my own until recently. I thought it would be fussy and hard to get just right, but I was in for a surprise: Lemon curd is super easy to…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Roasted mushrooms are underrated.&nbsp;Prove me wrong: when you have mushrooms you need to use up in the fridge, is roasting the first way you think to cook them? My guess is not. Many of us are more likely to sauté mushrooms on the stove than roast them in the oven. But as delicious as sautéed mushrooms are, I’d argue that roasted mushrooms are&nbsp;even better.&nbsp;They’re crisp around the edges, meaty in the middle, and packed with savory, umami flavor.&nbsp;Plus, they roast on a single sheet pan in under 30 minutes. I’m sharing my simple roasted mushrooms recipe below. Serve it as…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Roasted asparagus is the best spring side dish! Ready in 15 minutes, it’s so easy to make. Just trim the asparagus’s woody ends, toss it with olive oil, salt, and pepper, and pop it in the oven. Roasted asparagus is also delicious. The spears are juicy and tender (NOT stringy or mushy), and their tips are browned and crisp. I could happily eat oven roasted asparagus straight off the baking sheet. But I love it even more when I season it with a squeeze of fresh lemon juice, a punchy sauce, or flavorful garnishes. I’m sharing my simple roasted asparagus…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This lemon pasta recipe is my take on Italian pasta al limone. It’s buttery, garlicky, and bright with citrus, and best of all, it’s super easy to make. You can whip it up in 20 minutes using under 10 ingredients. Even though this lemon pasta feels elegant, it’s a perfect weeknight dinner. While many lemon pasta sauces call for heavy cream, I skip it here. Instead, butter, Parmesan, and starchy pasta cooking water create the pasta’s silky sauce. These simple ingredients let the fresh lemon flavor shine through. Citrus fans, get ready—you’re going to love this pasta!

I thought it would be a one-and-done lunch—just an easy way to use up my leftovers—but to my surprise, I got hooked. Before long, I was boiling more&nbsp;eggs to make&nbsp;more&nbsp;egg salad. This stuff is seriously good! This egg salad recipe is brighter and fresher than most. In my opinion, it’s what a classic egg salad recipe really wants&nbsp;to be. It’s still rich, creamy, and flavorful, but it uses far less mayo than is traditional. Lemon juice, Dijon mustard,…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Here’s the good news: perfect hard boiled eggs are easy to make. …And the bad news: so are less-than-perfect ones. I don’t know about you, but I’ve certainly cooked my fair share of the latter. When you try to peel away the shell, half the whites come along with it, or when you cut it open, the yolk is slightly green instead of brilliant yellow. Pretty disappointing, if you ask me. See, cooking perfect hard boiled eggs is easy, but that doesn’t mean that the process you use doesn’t matter. After years of trial and error, I’m happy to say…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>What are your favorite carrot recipes? If you said classic carrot cake or baby carrots and dip, you’re probably not alone. But I’m sharing 40+ of my best carrot recipes here in the hopes that you’ll try cooking this bright orange vegetable in a new way. They might seem humble, but carrots are insanely versatile. Roasted carrots make a wonderful side dish, for example, and carrot ginger soup is the perfect cozy meal for a cold day. Tangy pickled carrots are great for snacking, while a fresh carrot salad could be the star of your next picnic.

It’s a change from my usual breakfast casserole or frittata, and though it’s (much) more time-intensive, every second is worth it. This spinach quiche is melt-in-your mouth delicious. It has a buttery, flaky crust and a custardy egg filling that’s flecked with tender spinach, green onions, and salty feta cheese. If you’re tempted to try it, you can find my step-by-step guide to how to make quiche below, complete with all my best tips for quiche success.
