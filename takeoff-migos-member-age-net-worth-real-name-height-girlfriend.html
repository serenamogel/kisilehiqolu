However, when it comes to rapping, there is evidently no easy way to build one’s musical flow as it mainly requires eloquent symmetrical musical rhythm and perfect breath control. Consequently, only a few groups who ventured into this aspect of musical genres have succeeded in climbing the ladder of success. One of those few are the Migos, a trio group consisting of Takeoff, Quavo, and Offset.</p><p>However, our person of interest today amongst the trio group is Takeoff, the youngest member of the group who initially fell in love with wrestling before eventually taking a U-turn and becoming a rapper. Today, he is celebrated as one of the most talented rappers around and is mentioned in the same sentence with the likes of Drake, Snoop Dogg, etc. Read on to find out more about him</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=takeoff-%e2%80%93-bio-age-real-name></span><strong>Takeoff – Bio, Age, Real Name</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Takeoff was born as Kirshnik Khari Ball on the 18th of June 1994, in Lawrenceville, Georgia. He is an American and of African-American ethnicity. He is popularly known as the third and youngest member of the hip-hop trio group, Migos and it is no surprise that Takeoff is amazing at what he does as sources say that he is directly related to Keyate Marshall (Quavo) and&nbsp;Kiari Kendrell Cephus (Offset).</p><p>As regarding his parents, his father died when he was four, leaving him to the care of his mother who is a stylist. Life was pretty of a mix up for the rapper as he got everything he wanted and was trained to be a man by his mom and cousins (Quavo and Offset) who became part of his home after they were abandoned by their dad. Takeoff as a child nursed the ambition of being a wrestler, little did he know that he would someday storm the world as a rapper.</p><p>He started rapping when he was in eighth grade as he was influenced by Quavo who had gained expertise in the act and also had released a mixtape while at the high school. Initially,&nbsp;his performances were a spot for mockery during his high school days but as time went by, he became grounded with his amazing lyrical flow and also learned how to control his breath perfectly whilst rapping. Shortly after he became a pro, Takeoff and Quavo convinced Offset to join them leading to the birth of the formation of their first group, Polo Club.</p><p>Shortly after the birth of Polo Club, the group later decided to rebrand their name and chose the name Migos. Some sources say that their eventual band name, Migos was coined in reference to a drug house while others say that it was coined from the abbreviation of amigos, the reason being that there were famously three.</p><p>Migos’s first studio album, Yung Rich Nation was released under the&nbsp;independent label Quality Control Music on the 31st of July 2015. The album was a success and topped as the number 17 spot on the&nbsp;<i>Billboard</i>&nbsp;200. Regardless, before the release of the album, the group were notable for their many tours and their live performances all over the country. Subsequently, the group released another mixtape; Juug Season&nbsp;on August 25, 2011, following the mixtape No Label, on June 1, 2012.</p><p>Migos had its major breakthrough with the release of their single, Bad and Boujee which peaked as the number one spot on the&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Billboard</i>&nbsp;Hot 100. The single went ahead to receive lots of critical acclaims and was certified&nbsp;four times platinum&nbsp;by the&nbsp;Recording Industry Association of America&nbsp;(RIAA). Unfortunately, none of the credits earned by the album would be assigned to Takeoff as he was not featured in the song as a result of his busy schedules that period.</p><p>Later on, Takeoff, Quavo, and Offset (Migos) released their second studio album, Culture which also maintained the number one spot on the US Billboard 200. The album later went on to receive a platinum certification by RIAA sometime in July 2017. On the 26th of January 2018, the group second album was rebranded and released as Culture II.&nbsp;Like the others, Culture II was also a glam!</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=net-worth></span><strong>Net Worth</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Being a member of a group that had attained a lot of successes since it’s creation, Takeoff has evidently made a lot of fortune from his many musical gigs. The group, Migos is said to have a total net worth of&nbsp;$4.2 million and on Takeoff’s part, his financial value falls at $2 million.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=girlfriend></span><strong>Girlfriend&nbsp;</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>It is quite surprising that the rapper has not been seen or linked with any girl both in the present and in past. However, we wouldn’t be totally wrong to say that he has decided to keep this aspect of his life under lock and key.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=height></span><strong>Height</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Takeoff is the youngest member of the Migos group and shares the same height,&nbsp;5 feet 9 inches, with his cousin, Offset. Quavo on his part is just one inch taller than the duo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKyRoLKwssVmpKKfn6h6rrHMm5yrZZGcsm66xK1ksKeiqbVuvsSao2amkaKybrTEop6hrF2ctrO4xaugnqaUZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./showtimes-billions-carried-by-excellent-cast.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Showtimes Billions Carried by Excellent Cast | TV/Streaming</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./boo-bitch-fails-to-find-scares-or-heart.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Boo, Bitch Fails to Find Scares or Heart | TV/Streaming</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./emily-longnecker-wthr-bio-wiki-age-wedding-husband-salary-and-net-worth.html>Emily Longnecker WTHR Bio, Wiki, Age, Wedding, Husband, Salary and Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-do-you-get-a-banana-in-fruit-ninja-html.html>How do you get a banana in Fruit Ninja?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./january-jones-net-worth-2024.html>January Jones Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jim-starr-net-worth-3.html>Jim Starr Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./toosii-announces-u-s-headline-tour-in-support-of-his-debut-album-naujour-set-for-june-2-release.html></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX.
