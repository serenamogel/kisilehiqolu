Family And Ethnicity</a></p><h2>Pierre Palmade Car Accident</h2><p>A traffic collision that occurred last Friday in Seine-et-Marne has garnered media attention, as actor Pierre Palmade was involved in the crash.</p><p>The accident occurred on February 10, 2023, at around 7 p.m. on the RD372 in the Villiers-en-Bière town in Seine-et-Marne, near Dammarie-les-Lys.</p><p>Pierre Palmade’s car accident left five injured, three in severe condition. The circumstances of the collision were not specified.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/geniuscelebs.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-13-at-13.32.33.png><p>The French actor reportedly hit another car (a Renault Mégane), traveling on the other lane head-on with his car (a Peugeot 3008).</p><p>Moments later, the vehicles were hit by another car driven by an old man.</p><p>The Renault carried a pregnant woman in her thirties, her six-year-old son, her brother-in-law in his forties, and the vehicle driver.</p><p>The actor was taken to the Kremlin-Bicêtre’s hospital and was in critical condition but is currently <a href=# rel=noopener>out of danger</a>.</p><p>The pregnant woman was airlifted to the Beaujon hospital in Clichy, and the child was taken to the Necker Hospital.</p><p>The driver of the third vehicle was transported to the South Ile-de-France hospital in Melun.</p><p>The woman, seven months pregnant, suffered a miscarriage due to the trauma caused by the crash.</p><p>It was later announced that the woman was out of danger, but the other three were in critical condition.</p><p>Two men in Pierre’s car were seen fleeing the scene as soon as the accident occurred.
