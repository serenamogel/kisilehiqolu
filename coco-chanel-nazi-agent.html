Along with hobnobbing with artistic luminaries like <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/artists/pablo-picasso data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Pablo Picasso" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Pablo Picasso</a> and Serge Diaghilev, she became friends with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/winston-churchill data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Winston Churchill" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Winston Churchill</a> and mistress of Hugh Richard Arthur Grosvenor, the Duke of Westminster.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Chanel's prominent standing and connections helped her regain control over her life at a crucial time, as <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/adolf-hitler data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Adolf Hitler" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Adolf Hitler</a>’s forces began closing in on Germany’s neighbors in the late 1930s.</p><img alt="winston churchill, coco chanel and the duke of westminster" title="Winston Churchill, Coco Chanel and the Duke of Westminster" width=3047 height=3180 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/winston-churchill-coco-chanel-1883---1971-at-a-meet-of-the-duke-of-westminsters-boar-hounds-the-mimizan-hunt-near-dampierre-northern-france-photo-by-hulton-archivegetty-images.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Hugh Richard Arthur Grosvenor, the Duke of Westminster; Coco Chanel; and Winston Churchill</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Chanel dated a German military officer</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After the Nazis took over Paris in 1940, Chanel cozied up to Baron Hans Günther von Dincklage, an officer in Abwehr, the German military intelligence. Their romance enabled Chanel to move into comfortable living quarters at Paris' Hôtel Ritz, then doubling as a German headquarters, and kept her firmly entrenched in high society, which also had been infiltrated by German officers.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Chanel’s relations with Dincklage also allowed her to deal with important personal matters. Most pressing was her need to see to the release of her nephew André Palasse, who was imprisoned in a German stalag in 1940.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Then there were her business interests: Since 1924, when the Jewish Wertheimer family had backed the launch of her perfume line in exchange for most of the profits, the fashion maven had sought to renegotiate things on more favorable terms. Now, with “Aryanization” laws forcing Jews to give up their businesses, Chanel saw the opportunity to reclaim a lucrative branch of her empire.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Chanel became Abwehr Agent F-7124 in 1941</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Dincklage introduced his lover to another prominent Abwehr agent, Baron Louis de Vaufreland, who allegedly promised to help Chanel free her nephew in exchange for her service to Berlin. Sometime in 1941, Chanel was registered as Agent F-7124, with the code name of “Westminster,” after her former flame.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Tasked with obtaining “political information” from colleagues in Madrid, Chanel traveled to the Spanish city for a few months in mid-1941 with Vaufreland, under the guise of business dealings. According to Hal Vaughn’s book <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0307475913 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sleeping with the Enemy" data-vars-ga-product-id=b73547de-71cd-4226-9c60-460bcaa825c3 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0307475913 data-product-url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0307475913 data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0307475913 data-affiliate-network='{"id":"c754abb3-3204-4f94-a191-fe83f09385e4","site_id":"73ce8f33-abd8-4d76-b5c7-1c72caf717ce","metadata":{},"network":{"id":"469ce69f-4798-416d-9432-eaa9954b4053","name":"Amazon","metadata":{}}}' data-vars-ga-product-brand=Vintage data-vars-ga-product-price=$16.92 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=8ca4144e-54a4-4b4e-81f6-ee6a50d4a86b data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand=Vintage class="body-link product-links css-9lyfaf e1rq56bv0">Sleeping with the Enemy</a>, there is a record of her dinner with British diplomat Brian Wallace, during which she casually discussed life in occupied Paris and the animosity the French and Germans held toward each other.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">It’s unclear whether Chanel’s interactions in Madrid moved the needle in any way, but they were apparently enough to impress Abwehr supervisors and earn the release of Palasse.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">However, her desire to reclaim her perfume profits reached a dead end, as she learned that the Wertheimers had transferred control of the company to a non-Jewish Frenchman named Félix Amiot before fleeing to the United States.</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">She was outed as a German spy in 1944</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Sometime between late 1943 and early 1944, with the tide turning against Germany, Chanel was tapped for another mission by General Walter Schellenberg of the SS. Named Operation Modellhut, German for “model hat,” she was to use her personal connection to Churchill, now England’s prime minister, to relay word that many SS senior officers were seeking an end to the bloodshed.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Chanel arranged for the release of Vera Lombardi, a mutual friend of hers and Churchill's, from an Italian prison. They traveled to Madrid with Dincklage, where Lombardi was instructed to hand over Chanel's letter to Churchill at the British Embassy.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">However, this plan was blown up when Lombardi denounced Chanel and her associates as German spies. Lombardi was taken back into custody, though Chanel managed to safely return to Paris.</p><h2 data-node-id=21 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Chanel escaped punishment and erased evidence of her actions that tied her to Abwehr</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In August 1944, a few months after the Madrid fiasco, French forces reclaimed Paris from the Germans. With her reputation as a “horizontal collaborator,” Chanel was taken in for questioning before the Free French Purge Committee, though she was released in short order and promptly fled to Switzerland.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After the war’s conclusion, Chanel appeared in a French court to account for sworn testimony from arrested German officers that tied her to Abwehr. She managed to wriggle her way out of trouble, confirming that Vaufreland had promised to get her nephew out of prison but otherwise denying the extent of their interactions.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">According to Sleeping with the Enemy, Chanel also took care to erase evidence of her actions, where possible. Upon learning that an ailing Schellenberg was planning to publish his memoir, Chanel paid his medical bills and ensured his family was on sound financial footing; the subsequent memoir had no mention of her involvement as an agent.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Ultimately, Chanel never endured any ramifications for her wartime dealings with the Nazis. She made a celebrated return to the fashion world in 1954, aided by the very same Wertheimer family she had fought for so many years, and lived out her years as a celebrity, before her death at the Hôtel Ritz in 1971.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGifoqukpL%2B6ecKuo62topp8pLvCqGScoJGjsq15zZqxomWRnLKvwA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./emily-wears-net-worth-income-salary-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Emily Wears Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./3-little-known-facts-about-florence-pugh.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>3 Little-Known Facts About Florence Pugh</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./emily-longnecker-wthr-bio-wiki-age-wedding-husband-salary-and-net-worth.html>Emily Longnecker WTHR Bio, Wiki, Age, Wedding, Husband, Salary and Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-do-you-get-a-banana-in-fruit-ninja-html.html>How do you get a banana in Fruit Ninja?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./january-jones-net-worth-2024.html>January Jones Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jim-starr-net-worth-3.html>Jim Starr Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./toosii-announces-u-s-headline-tour-in-support-of-his-debut-album-naujour-set-for-june-2-release.html></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX.
