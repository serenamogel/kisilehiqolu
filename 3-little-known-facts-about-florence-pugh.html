In 2019, she started dating prominent actor and director Zach Braff, well known for his role as John “J.D.” Dorian in the hospital drama Scrubs.</p><p>The social media connection between Florence Pugh and Zach Braff started in 2018 when Braff commended Pugh on Twitter for her performance in the historical drama Lady Macbeth. They started dating in 2019 after the publication of Braff’s short film for Adobe Cloud, In The Time It Takes to Get There, in which Pugh starred with Alicia Silverstone as a 19th-century influencer.</p><p>Pugh recently confessed in an interview with Harper’s Bazaar that she and Braff, who is 21 years her older, discreetly split up early this year after dating for almost two years:</p><p>“We’ve been trying to do this separation without the rest of the world knowing since it’s a relationship on which everyone has an opinion.” We simply believed that doing something like this would help us avoid having millions of people tell us how pleased they are that we aren’t together. So that’s what we did. When I speak about it, I get a knot in my throat.”</p><p>In light of the couple’s divorce, here are some lesser-known facts about Florence Pugh.</p><h2>3 facts about Florence Pugh that you may not be aware of</h2><h2>1) She loves both pets and plants.</h2><p>Florence Pugh is obsessed with succulents. She has a cactus called Barry, about whom she provides a series of updates on her Instagram Stories on a daily basis. She even conducted surgery on the cactus to rescue it after receiving tips from her admirers.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Florence-Pugh.jpg alt="Florence Pugh" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Pugh is also a huge dog fan. Sir Albert Pugh, her dog, has his own Instagram hashtag, #SirAlbertPugh. During the COVID-19 epidemic in April 2020, she fostered a dog called Billie from the Los Angeles-based animal rescue group Labelle Foundation with her then-partner Zach Braff. They eventually decided to legally adopt Billie.</p><h2>2) She enjoys cooking.</h2><p>Florence Pugh’s passion for cooking should come as no surprise given her father, restaurateur Clinton Pugh. Her amateur culinary career began during the COVID-19 epidemic when she moved into Zach Braff’s Los Angeles house. Culinary With Flo, her YouTube channel, contains cooking films shot in Braff’s opulent and vast kitchen.&nbsp;The engaging movies highlight Pugh’s passion for cooking and provide fast dishes using leftover food. She also discusses her day and often dances around the kitchen to the music she is listening to. Billie, the couple’s adopted dog, appears in the videos on occasion.&nbsp;Pugh also claimed in her Harper’s Bazaar interview that she is now prepping her kitchen in London so that she may resume Cooking With Flo.</p><h2>3) She began her career as a vocalist.</h2><p>Florence Pugh, like her actor brother Toby Sebastian, is a gifted musician who creates her own music in addition to being a successful actress. She also knows how to play the guitar and the piano. Pugh began her career by singing covers on YouTube as Flossie Rose before transitioning to acting. Among her most famous renditions is Bob Dylan’s song Make You Feel My Love and Oasis’ Wonderwall. Florence Pugh has a slew of high-profile movies coming out in 2022 and 2023, including Olivia Wilde’s, Don’t Worry Darling, in which she co-stars with Harry Styles, Gemma Chan, KiKi Layne, and Chris Pine.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Florence-Pugh.jpeg alt="Florence Pugh" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>This will be followed by an adaptation of Emma Donoghue’s The Wonder and Christopher Nolan’s much-anticipated star-studded feature Oppenheimer, starring Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, and Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., and Rami Malek.
