Ferren Lee-Kelly. She began singing at an early age and was raised in San Francisco.</p><p>Just a few of the musical genres that Lee included into his sound were dance, pop, and R&B.</p><p>She is well known for her wide vocal range and seductive stage presence. By releasing CDs in both Mandarin and English, she was able to reach a wide audience.</p><p>In the late 1990s, Lee had considerable success in Asia and made a breakthrough in the Western music scene.</p><p>She built her reputation in the music industry by working with well-known musicians including Quincy Jones, Leehom Wang, and Julio Iglesias.</p><p>Everyone was shocked by her premature passing, especially after learning the reason. Let’s look more closely at Coco Lee’s religion and other aspects.</p><h2>Religion of Coco Lee: Was She a Christian?</h2><p>Although Coco Lee’s religion has not been made public, most people believe that she is a Christian.</p><p>A multi-talented Chinese-American artist named Ferren Lee also went by the name Coco Lee (L mn in Chinese).</p><p>She had artistic abilities as a dancer, singer, actor, and record producer. Coco Lee started her career in Hong Kong before spreading her name to Taiwan.</p><p>It’s remarkable because her song “Do You Want My Love” made it onto the American music charts.</p><p>“Just No Other Way,” the singer’s first English-language album, was released in 1999. One of Coco Lee’s amazing journey’s highlights was a breathtaking Oscars performance.</p><p>She sang the Best Original Song nominee “A Love Before Time” from the celebrated film “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.”</p><p>Coco Lee sadly passed away unexpectedly on July 5, 2023, at the age of 48, leaving behind a legacy of artistic accomplishments. The singer took her own life in order to end it.</p><h2>Coco Lee’s ethnicity, place of origin, and nationality</h2><p>Born in Hong Kong, Coco Lee is an American singer, songwriter, record producer, dancer, and actor.</p><p>Chinese immigrants from Indonesia and Hong Kong, respectively, were Coco’s parents. Her husband was a Canadian businessman named Bruce Rockowitz.</p><p>Several years ago, the actress struggled with depression, according to Carol and Nancy Lee, the actress’ older sisters, whose message was posted on Facebook and Instagram. But in recent months, her condition has drastically deteriorated.</p><p>Despite CoCo’s efforts to overcome her sadness and professional support, the statement said that “that demon inside of her took the better of her.”</p><p>Her sister claims that Lee made an attempt at suicide at home over the weekend and was sent to the hospital. She apparently died on Wednesday while still unconscious.</p><p>The 1990s and 2000s saw Lee have a prosperous pop singing career throughout Asia. Lee, who was born in Hong Kong, finally moved to the US and finished middle and high school there.</p><p>Lee, who began her career as a Mandopop singer, diversified over her almost 30-year career by releasing albums in Cantonese and English.</p><p>She provided the voice of the title character Fa Mulan in the Mandarin version of Disney’s Mulan and sang the Mandarin version of the movie’s theme song, “Reflection.”</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read, Kaylin Wiley, Averie Gilley, and Sophierosejm."}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1053569,"3":{"1":0},"10":2,"11":0,"12":0,"15":"Arial","23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":23}{"1":25,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":38}{"1":44,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":56}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/kaylin-wiley/"}{"1":23}{"1":25,"2":"https://popularbio.com/averie-gilley/"}{"1":38}{"1":44,"2":"https://popularbio.com/sophierosejm/"}{"1":56}'>Also Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Kaylin Wiley</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Averie Gilley</a>, and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Sophierosejm</a>.</span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Singer-Songwriter</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Pete Burns Tattoos Meaning And Design | Dead Or Alive Lead Vocalist</a></h3>Burns' role as the band Dead or Alive's main vocalist made him particularly well-known throughout the 1980s and 1990s.
