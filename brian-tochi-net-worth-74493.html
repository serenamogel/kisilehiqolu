Produced by Leonard Stern and cowritten by Chris Hayward and Allan Burns, it also starred Jack <a href=#>Cassidy</a> as an egomaniacal actor, Kenneth Mars, and <a href=#>Hamilton Camp</a>. That same year saw Tochi appearing in "And the Children Shall Lead", a third-season episode of <i>Star Trek: The Original Series</i>. Other roles followed, including guest appearances on such popular shows as <i>The Brady Bunch</i>, <i>The Partridge Family</i> and <i>Adam-12</i>.</p><span>1970</span><p>During the mid-1970s, Tochi spent time in the theatre, this time reprising his role as Crown <a href=#>Prince</a> Chulalongkorn in the Los Angeles Civic Light Opera's revival of the musical <i>The King and I</i> at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. There he co-starred with actor Ricardo MontalbÃ¡n, as the King of Siam, to which they would later accompany the show as it went on tour. When the show ended its run, the two remained dear to one another, with Tochi and MontalbÃ¡n rendezvousing regularly for lunch during the run of <i>Fantasy Island</i>.</p><span>1977</span><p>Tochi returned to star in another TV series <i>Space Academy</i> (1977â€“1979) with veteran actor Jonathan Harris (best remembered as Dr. Smith from <i>Lost in Space</i>). His character, Tee Gar Soom, had super-strength and continued the martial arts traditions of his Asian ancestors. During hiatus of the show, Tochi was asked to shoot a 20-minute promotional "behind-the-scenes" visit to the Space Academy for a popular daytime series, <i>Razzmatazz</i>, on CBS. Razzmatazz was a highly regarded news magazine show produced by Don Hewitt and the same production team as CBS's primetime news show, <i>60 Minutes</i>. It starred Barry Bostwick, who opted to leave the show for a career in features, to capitalize on his recently released cult classic <i>The Rocky Horror Picture Show</i>. Searching for a new host, the television network persuaded Tochi to accept their offer of his own daytime show, which aired on the network for 4 more years into the early 1980s.</p><span>1985</span><p>Tochi's debut as a series regular was as Yul Brynner's oldest son and heir Crown <a href=#>Prince</a> Chulalongkorn in <i>Anna and the King</i> on CBS. It was based on the film version of Rodgers and Hammerstein's <i>The King and I</i> and also starred Samantha Eggar and Keye Luke. Although the series was short-lived, Tochi and Brynner remained friends until his death in 1985. Concurrent with the series, Tochi was cast with fellow actor Luke in his first animated television series <i>The Amazing Chan and the Chan Clan</i>; also in the series was a young Jodie Foster, who voiced his sister.</p><span>1990</span><p>As a voice actor, Tochi has provided voices for numerous animated films, computer games and animated cartoon series, including the <i>Bionic Six</i> (all 65 episodes), <i>Challenge of the GoBots</i>, <i>Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo</i>, <i>What's New, Scooby-Doo?</i>, <i>The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest</i>, and <i>Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm</i> (as its main star Liu Kang). He performed the voice of Leonardo in the first three <i>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</i> films in the early 1990s. He also is the voice of the <a href=#>Chinese</a> soldier who runs the Great Wall in Disney's <i>Mulan</i>, and more recently had recurring roles in <i>Batman Beyond</i>, <i>As Told by Ginger</i>, <i>Kim Possible</i>, <i>Johnny Bravo</i>, <i>Static Shock</i>, <i>Family Guy</i> and <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender</i> on Nickelodeon.</p><span>2004</span><p>In 2004, Tochi co-wrote, produced and directed <i>Tales of a Fly on the Wall</i>, a scripted, live-action comedy, casting several of his friends in lead roles; it included fellow actors Roscoe Lee Browne, his <i>Revenge of the Nerds</i> co-star Curtis Armstrong and his <i>Police Academy 3: Back in Training</i> co-star Leslie Easterbrook. In 2005, he was one of the winners of the Hollywood Film Festival's Hollywood Screenplay Awards, taking home top honors for co-writing the screenplay "In the Heat of the Light". He continues with his directing, producing, and screenwriting careers.</p><span>2018</span><p>Tochi was born in Los Angeles, <a href=#>California</a>. He is the son of Joe Isao Tochihara (A.K.A. â€˜Tochiâ€™), a Beverly Hills <a href=#>Celebrity</a> hair salon owner, and Jane Yaeko (nÃ©e Harada), both <a href=#>Japanese</a>, and both of whom were forcibly interned during World War II. While Tochi was still young, the family moved from Los Angeles to Orange County, <a href=#>California</a>, where he divided his education between local public schools and studio tutors (for child actors) on movie studio lots. After graduation from high school, Tochi also attended U.S.C., UCLA, and U.C.I.</p><span>2019</span><p>Tochiâ€™s introduction into the entertainment industry came as a toddler. His fatherâ€™s beauty salon, Tochi Coiffure of Beverly Hills, was a popular haunt for many famous clients, including Lana Turner, Hedy Lamarr, Lucille Ball, Judy Garland, Petula Clark and Patty Duke. One of his fatherâ€™s customers, a top child agent, spotted the young Tochi running around the salon, and quickly signed to represent him.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.idolnetworth.com/images/play_game.png alt="More or less Game" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <a href=# class=btn>Play Game</a><h2>Tags:</h2><a href=#>1959 births</a> <a href=#>Living people</a> <a href=#>American male child actors</a> <a href=#>American male film actors</a> <a href=#>American film producers</a> <a href=#>American male screenwriters</a> <a href=#>American male television actors</a> <a href=#>American television journalists</a> <a href=#>American male voice actors</a> <a href=#>Male actors from Los Angeles</a> <a href=#>American people of Japanese descent</a> <a href=#>American male actors of Japanese descent</a> <a href=#>American male journalists</a> <a href=#>American journalists of Japanese descent</a> <a href=#>American film directors of Japanese descent</a> <a href=#>Film directors from California</a> <a href=#>Screenwriters from California</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmeSp7aiuoytppygmWK7psCMsKarrJhihHWAmGw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./recipe-index-root.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Lemon Poppy Seed Muffins</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./100-cute-pomeranian-dog-names-with-meanings.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>100+ Cute Pomeranian Dog Names With Meanings</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./emily-longnecker-wthr-bio-wiki-age-wedding-husband-salary-and-net-worth.html>Emily Longnecker WTHR Bio, Wiki, Age, Wedding, Husband, Salary and Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-do-you-get-a-banana-in-fruit-ninja-html.html>How do you get a banana in Fruit Ninja?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./january-jones-net-worth-2024.html>January Jones Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jim-starr-net-worth-3.html>Jim Starr Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./toosii-announces-u-s-headline-tour-in-support-of-his-debut-album-naujour-set-for-june-2-release.html></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX.
