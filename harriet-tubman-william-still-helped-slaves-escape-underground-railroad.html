Among the ones most tied to the journey to freedom were <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/activists/harriet-tubman data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Harriet Tubman" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Harriet Tubman</a>, one of the most famous “conductors,” and William Still, often called the “Father of the Underground Railroad.”</p><h2 data-node-id=2 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Harriet Tubman escaped slavery and guided others to freedom</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Born into slavery in Maryland with the name Araminta Harriet Ross, Tubman herself escaped to freedom, thanks to the Underground Railroad. While enslaved, she suffered regular physical violence and torture throughout her childhood. One of the most severe was when a two-pound weight was thrown at her head, causing her to endure seizures and narcoleptic episodes throughout her life.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">She married a free man, John Tubman, in 1844, but not much is known about their relationship except that she took his last name. Five years later, she found herself sick, and when her owner died, she decided it was time to escape to Philadelphia. She started the journey with her brothers but ultimately made the 90-mile trip on her own in 1849.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“When I found I had crossed that line, I looked at my hands to see if I was the same person,” she said of making it into the free state of Pennsylvania, where she took on her mother’s name of Harriet. “There was such a glory over everything; the sun came like gold through the trees, and over the fields, and I felt like I was in Heaven.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But experiencing freedom wasn’t enough for Tubman — she couldn’t bear the thought of her family being enslaved, so she crossed back in 1850 to lead her niece’s family to Philadelphia. In 1851, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.anb.org/view/10.1093/anb/9780198606697.001.0001/anb-9780198606697-e-1500707 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="she went back to bring her husband across the line" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">she went back to bring her husband across the line</a>, only to find that he was married to another woman and had no desire to move North. Instead, she led a group of escaped bonds people. Those were just two of the trips she made between 1850 and 1860 (estimates range from 13 to 19 total trips), reportedly guiding more than 300 enslaved people to freedom. Among those she saved were her parents and siblings.</p><img alt="Harriet Tubman, c. 1865" title="Harriet Tubman, c. 1865" width=2908 height=4266 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-3232998.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Harriet Tubman, c.&lt;em>&amp;nbsp;1865.&lt;/em>; Photo: Hulton Archive/Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The dangers were heightened when the Fugitive Slave Law was passed in 1850, stating that escaped enslaved people caught in the North could be returned to slavery. But Tubman simply worked around that and steered her Underground Railroad to Canada, where slavery was prohibited (there’s evidence one of her stops on an 1851 trip was at the home of abolitionist <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/activists/frederick-douglass data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Frederick Douglass" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Frederick Douglass</a>). Her work as a “conductor” (those who guided the enslaved along the Underground Railroad) earned her the nickname “Moses,” which happened to be the actual name of her younger brother.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">"I was conductor of the Underground Railroad for eight years, and I can say what most conductors can't say,” <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.pbs.org/black-culture/explore/harriet-tubman/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="she proudly said" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">she proudly said</a>. “I never ran my train off the track and I never lost a passenger."</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">William Still helped more than 800 enslaved people escape</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Meanwhile, William Still was born into freedom in Burlington County, New Jersey, a free state.

Around this time, he started helping fugitive enslaved people by housing them in the years before the Civil War. His Underground Railroad “station” became a popular stop where he helped shepherd those enslaved to Canada.

Harriet was a woman of no pretensions, indeed, a more ordinary specimen of humanity could hardly be found among the most unfortunate-looking farm hands of the South. Yet, in point of courage, shrewdness and disinterested exertions to rescue her fellow-men, by making personal visits to Maryland among the enslaved, she was without her equal.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">He went on to praise her success as “wonderful,” noting her multiple journeys into the danger zone. “Great fears were entertained for her safety, but she seemed wholly devoid of personal fear,” he continued. “The idea of being captured by enslaved-hunters or enslaved-holders, seemed never to enter her mind. She was apparently proof against all adversaries.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The 2019 film Harriet, in which Cynthia Erivo plays Harriet Tubman and Leslie Odom Jr. plays William Still, will dive into the life and spirit of Tubman — and the part that Still played, as they both guided so many on the road to freedom.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGiYnKyZq7a0wNJon5qqop6ytXnTrpmmmZ5ixKq4y6KYpmWjqbatuIyhnKWolZl6tLjAr5ysZZWosKK8xGasp5yVp7Szu9Snm2aqkZ65s7vAnQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-ben-waites-from-americas-got-talent.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Ben Waites From Americas Got Talent?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./housekeeping-1988.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Housekeeping movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1988)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./emily-longnecker-wthr-bio-wiki-age-wedding-husband-salary-and-net-worth.html>Emily Longnecker WTHR Bio, Wiki, Age, Wedding, Husband, Salary and Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-do-you-get-a-banana-in-fruit-ninja-html.html>How do you get a banana in Fruit Ninja?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./january-jones-net-worth-2024.html>January Jones Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jim-starr-net-worth-3.html>Jim Starr Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./toosii-announces-u-s-headline-tour-in-support-of-his-debut-album-naujour-set-for-june-2-release.html></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX.
