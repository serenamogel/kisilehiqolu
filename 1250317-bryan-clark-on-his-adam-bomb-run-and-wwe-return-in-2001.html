Now, Clark is reflecting on his time in WWE.&nbsp;</span><span>Speaking on the <a href=#>Shining Wizards podcast</a>, Clark discussed his return, his original run, and more. Below are some highlights sent by the team from the podcast:</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I liked it.&nbsp;&nbsp;I’ve told this story before.&nbsp;&nbsp;They offered me two different gimmicks, and I’ve told people if they don’t believe me, go to the trademark commission and look it up.&nbsp;&nbsp;But they had the Adam Bomb trademark and The Ringmaster.&nbsp;&nbsp;I chose Adam Bomb.&nbsp;&nbsp;I just felt I could do a lot more with it.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was, like you said, very colorful.&nbsp;&nbsp;[The character] had a lot of potential I felt at the time.</p><p>:&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a couple people say that, but I never did hear it because prior to that, we were on a European Tour and I worked with Earthquake for like ten nights in a row preparing for Mania.&nbsp;&nbsp;That’s sort of the way they did it at the time.&nbsp;&nbsp;We had like a 15 minute match worked out.&nbsp;&nbsp;A damn good match actually.&nbsp;&nbsp;I’m hearing Ludvig Borga stuff now, but I think he may have left or got terminated prior, maybe in January prior to that.&nbsp;&nbsp;I’m not sure.&nbsp;&nbsp;We started working all those nights prior too in Europe.&nbsp;&nbsp;Germany and UK, but again I can’t quite pinpoint the date.</p><p>&nbsp;It was just Kronik, and Brian (Adams) wanted to go a lot more than I did.&nbsp;&nbsp;I told Brian, and we talked about this.&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought we should go to Japan right away.&nbsp;&nbsp;He was friends with ‘Taker so he thought maybe we should go back to Vince.&nbsp;&nbsp;We both left there and we always had that unsettling heat.&nbsp;&nbsp;We just felt like, and I even felt like – and he did once we&nbsp;got there – that this was not a good idea.&nbsp;&nbsp;They did a hotshot of an angle, but Kane had a big staph infection and I think Taker had a shoulder injury.&nbsp;&nbsp;I had basically a broken neck and we were all just banged up.&nbsp;&nbsp;They didn’t give us the time, and I said “hey, let’s go on the road for a little bit and get a feel for each other versus just hot-shotting it.”&nbsp; It fell apart.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we went to All-Japan like I suggested from the beginning.</p><p>http://show.shiningwizards.com/shining-wizards/episode-546-dropping-bombs-roks/</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZFuZ2xpZ2Kvs8XAp2ScpJGnuG67zWafoqtdlrGiuYybpqaaXafCr3nAp5tmr6eaerOx066pp2WZo3pzfI9q</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-real-reason-jojo-is-speaking-out-about-race.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Real Reason JoJo Is Speaking Out About Race</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./all-about-hafthor-julius-bjornssons-wife-kelsey-henson.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>All About Hafr Jlus Bjrnsson's Wife</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./emily-longnecker-wthr-bio-wiki-age-wedding-husband-salary-and-net-worth.html>Emily Longnecker WTHR Bio, Wiki, Age, Wedding, Husband, Salary and Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-do-you-get-a-banana-in-fruit-ninja-html.html>How do you get a banana in Fruit Ninja?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./january-jones-net-worth-2024.html>January Jones Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jim-starr-net-worth-3.html>Jim Starr Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./toosii-announces-u-s-headline-tour-in-support-of-his-debut-album-naujour-set-for-june-2-release.html></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX.
