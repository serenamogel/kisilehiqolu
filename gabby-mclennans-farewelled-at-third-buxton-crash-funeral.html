You never changed for anybody and I hope to make you proud because I sure will try.”</p><p>Gabby’s former teacher and soccer coach told the crowd the proudest moment of his teaching career was when she refused to keep playing on the team when he was planning on leaving.</p><p>“They say that teachers are not supposed to have favourites, but Gabby definitely had and continues to have a special place in my heart,” he said.</p><p>“She was a sensitive young lady and you needed to take your time to really get to know her well. She played her cards very close to her chest - but at the same time, she had a big heart - a heart of gold.</p><p>“She was a beautiful person, both on the inside and out.”</p><p>The family also thanked emergency services and first responders who dealt with the aftermath of the crash, as well as Red Cross volunteers for their support.</p><p>Guests started to arrive just before 10am, openly embracing and crying outside the service in heartbreaking scenes.</p><p>A large black limousine arrived with more attendees as the chapel courtyard quickly filled up with heartbroken guests.</p><p>A message in the funeral pamphlet read: “Life isn’t measured by the years you live, but by the love you gave and things you did.</p><p>“Yesterday’s memories are more precious than gold.</p><p>“They’re locked in our hearts to have and to hold.”</p><p>Attendees have been asked by the family to wear sky blue, Gabby‘s favourite colour.</p><p>She will be buried within the grounds of Forest Lawn Memorial Park following the service.</p><p>The tight-knit community southwest of Sydney is still struggling to come to terms with the tragedy that claimed the lives of five teens.<br>Gabby, 15, Tyrese Bechard, 16, Summer Williams, 14, Antonio Desisto, 15, and Lily Van De Putte, 15, were all killed when the ute they were travelling in hit a tree on East Parade at Buxton on September 6.</p><p>All five of the teenagers went to school together at Picton High.</p><p>Gabby was only identified as the fifth crash victim earlier this week after her devastated family released photos to the media that best “capture Gabby”.</p><p>The 15-year-old played soccer for her local team and was in a relationship with Tyrese.</p><p>Saturday’s service was the third of five ceremonies after Tyrese’s funeral was held on Thursday and Lily’s was on Friday.</p><p>On Thursday, Tyrese’s fellow students released orange balloons into the air as they said their final goodbyes at his final resting place.</p><p>In honour of Lily, mourners on Friday brought purple balloons and wore a little splash of purple in a nod to the “cheeky” 14-year-old.</p><p>Wollondilly Shire Council residents have been encouraged to display sky blue balloons for Gabby, her favourite colour.</p><p>Tyrese was remembered as a “cheeky” young man with a “heart of gold”, with hundreds of grieving mourners attending the emotional service at Picton’s HisHouse Church.</p><p>Loved ones, members of the community and fellow school students openly wept for the “kind”, “respectful” and “joyful” teen.</p><p>Lily was described as both “a tomboy and a lady” who had a “wicked sense of humour” to hundreds of loved ones on Friday.</p><p>Brittany, Lily’s sister, called her “kind” and “brave”, while the officiant said she thought “<span>being a bit of a redneck wasn’t such a bad thing”.</span></p><p>The teens had told their parents they were going on a “maccas run” but reportedly drove around for hours.
